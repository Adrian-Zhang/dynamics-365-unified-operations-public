# Landed cost entities overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Landed cost module allows businesses to streamline inbound shipping operations by providing complete financial and logistical control of imported freight from the manufacturer to the warehouse. Transaction data entities for Landed cost allow external data sources (such as freight forwarder services) to create voyages and costs and to update container tracking records. Supported operations include:

- Create and update voyage, shipping container, and folio records for existing inbound order lines.
- Create and update estimated costs for each cost area.
- Create and update shipping container activity records to capture the start, estimated end, and actual end dates for each leg of the containers journey.
- Create vendor cost invoice allocations.
