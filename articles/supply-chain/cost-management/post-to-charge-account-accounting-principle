# Post to charge account accounting principle

To enable the *post to charge* accounting principle, go to **Accounts payable \> Setup \> Accounts payable parameters**, open the **Invoice** tab, and set **Post to charge account in ledger** to *Yes*. This setting allows you to account for, and more easily reconcile, when there is a difference in the unit price between a physical and financial posting, indirect costs on purchased items, or charges on a purchase order.

There are two types of accounts payable charges code configurations that can cause a purchase order to affect the valuation of inventory assets. These charge codes are set up on the **Accounts payable \> Charges setup \> Charges code** page.

- For charges codes where **Debit Type** is set to *Item* and the **Credit Type** is set to *Ledger account*, the ledger account selected as the absorption account acts as a stock variation account.
- For charges codes where **Debit Type** is set to *Item* and the **Credit Type** is set to *Customer/Vendor*, the charge will be accounted as material cost, and the stock variation account of the item will be used.

## European special accounting rule

In Europe, the *post to charge account* accounting principle is commonly used for incorporating a special accounting rule. For example, it is common to account for inventory changes in either of the following two ways:

- *Cost of sales method* – This approach is supported by the standard inventory posting profile configuration, without using the *post to charge account* accounting principle.
- *Nature of expense method* – Smaller organizations very often follow this process, which typically involves the following steps:
    1. At the time goods or services are received, they are fully expensed.
    2. At the end of the period, a cycle count is performed.
    3. A manual adjustment is posted for the quantity and value into inventory. (The offset account is a stock variation account that offsets the expense posted in the first step. As a result, you only see the variation in the stock value on this account.)

By making use of the *post to charge account* principle, you can fully automate the two postings, which eliminates a manual period-end closing adjustment posting.

## Enable the post to charge account accounting principle

To enable the *post to charge account* accounting principle, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Accounts payable \> Setup \> Accounts payable parameters**.
2. Open the **Invoice** tab.
3. Expand the **Invoice** FastTab and set **Post to charge account in ledger** to *Yes*.
4. Close the page.

## Prerequisites and recommended parameters for the post to charge account accounting principle

If you plan to account for purchase charges and stock variations, the following conditions must be met:

- On the **Accounts payable \> Setup \> Accounts payable parameters** page, on the **Invoice** tab, **Post to charge account in ledger** must be set to *Yes*.
- On the **Cost management \> Inventory accounting policies setup \> Item model groups** page, the following options must be set for each relevant model group that contains items included in a purchase order:
  - **Post physical inventory** must be set to *Yes*.
  - **Post financial inventory** must be set to *Yes*.
  - **Accrue liability on product receipt** must be set to *Yes*.
- On the **Procurement and sourcing \> Setup \> Procurement and sourcing parameters** page, on the **Delivery** tab, **Generate charges on product receipt** must be set to *Yes*.
- On the **Inventory management \> Setup \> Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page, on the **Inventory accounting** tab, **Post packing slip in ledger** must be set to *Yes*.
- On the **Inventory management \> Setup \> Posting \> Posting** page, main accounts that apply to each relevant item must be specified for each of the following posting types (on the **Purchase order** tab):
  - **Purchase expenditure, un-invoiced**
  - **Purchase expenditure for product**
  - **Stock variation**

## Example scenario 1: Change in unit cost price

Prerequisites for this example:

- FIFO costing model

The following procedure shows an example of what happens when you change the unit cost price on a purchase order:

1. Create a purchase order for an item with a quantity of 1 and a unit price of 100.00.
2. Confirm the purchase order.
3. Post the product receipt for the purchase order.
4. Validate the voucher on the product receipt. The following table shows a sample voucher.

    | Posting type | Main account | Main account name | Account type | Debit/Credit? | Clearing account | Physical/Financial? | Amount |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Purchase, stock variation | 600170 | Stock variation materials | Expense | Credit | No | Physical | -100.00 |
    | Cost of purchased materials received | 140100 | Materials Inventory | Asset | Debit | Yes | Physical | 100.00 |
    | Purchase expenditure, un-invoiced | 600180 | Material Receipts | Expense | Debit | Yes | Physical | 100.00 |
    | Purchase, accrual | 200140 | Accrued Purchases | Liability | Credit | Yes | Physical | -100.00 |

5. Post the invoice for the purchase order with an updated unit price of 110.00.
6. Validate the voucher on the invoice. The following table shows a sample voucher.

    | Posting type | Main account | Main account name | Account type | Debit/Credit? | Clearing account | Physical/Financial? | Amount |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Purchase, stock variation | 600170 | Stock variation materials | Expense | Credit | No | Financial | -10.00 |
    | Cost of purchased materials received | 140100 | Materials Inventory | Asset | Debit | Yes | Financial | -100.00 |
    | Purchase expenditure, un-invoiced | 600180 | Material Receipts | Expense | Debit | Yes | Financial | -100.00 |
    | Purchase, accrual | 200140 | Accrued Purchases | Liability | Credit | Yes | Financial | 100.00 |
    | Cost of purchased materials invoiced | 140100 | Materials Inventory | Asset | Debit | No | Financial | 110.00 |
    | Purchase expenditure for product | 600180 | Materials Receipt | Expense | Credit | No | Financial | 110.00 |
    | Vendor balance | 211000 | Accounts Payable Trade | Liability | Credit | No | Financial | -110.00 |

## Example 2: Charges and indirect costs on the purchase order

Prerequisites for this example:

- FIFO costing model
- Charges code 1: Debit item and credit ledger account for 10%
- Charges code 2: Debit item and credit customer/vendor for 10.00 proportional
- Indirect cost: 2.00%  added to the purchase price

The following procedure shows an example of what happens when you include charges and indirect costs on a purchase order:

1. Create a purchase order for an item with a quantity of 1 and a unit price of 100.00.
2. Add one charges code for 10% that debits the item and credits the Ledger.
3. Add one charges code for 10.00 that debits the item and credits the customer/vendor.
4. Allocate the charges to the lines of the purchase order.
5. Confirm the purchase order.
6. Post the product receipt for the purchase order.
7. Validate the voucher on the product receipt. The following table shows a sample voucher.

    | Posting type | Main account | Main account name | Account type | Debit/ Credit? | Clearing account | Physical or Financial | Amount |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Purchase, stock variation | 600170 | Stock variation materials | Expense | Credit | No | Physical | -110.00 |
    | Estimated indirect cost absorbed | 600520 | Absorbed Indirect Costs | Expense | Credit | Yes | Physical | -2.40 |
    | Purchase freight | 600120 | Freight/ Transportation Costs | Expense | Credit | No | Physical | -10.00 |
    | Cost of purchased materials received | 140100 | Materials Inventory | Asset | Debit | Yes | Physical | 122.40 |
    | Purchase expenditure, un-invoiced | 600180 | Material Receipts | Expense | Debit | Yes | Physical | 110.00 |
    | Purchase, accrual | 200140 | Accrued Purchases | Liability | Credit | Yes | Physical | -110.00 |

8. Post the invoice for the purchase order.
9. Validate the voucher on the invoice. The following table shows a sample voucher.

    | Posting type | Main account | Main account name | Account type | Debit/Credit? | Clearing account | Physical/Financial? | Amount |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Purchase, stock variation | 600170 | Stock variation materials | Expense | Credit | No | Financial | 0.00 |
    | Estimated indirect cost absorbed | 600520 | Absorbed Indirect Costs | Expense | Debit | Yes | Financial | 2.40 |
    | Indirect cost absorbed | 600520 | Absorbed Indirect Costs | Expense | Debit | No | Financial | -2.40 |
    | Cost of purchased materials received | 140100 | Materials Inventory | Asset | Credit | Yes | Financial | -110.00 |
