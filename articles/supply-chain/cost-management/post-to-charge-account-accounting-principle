# Post to charge account accounting principle

The post to charge accounting principle is enabled by selecting the **Post to charge account in ledger** parameter on the **Invoice** tab in the **Accounts payable parameters** page. This parameter allows you to account for and more easily reconcile when there is a difference in the unit price between the physical and financial posting, indirect costs on purchased items, or charges on a purchase order.

Charges on a purchase order can affect the valuation of inventory assets when configured in two ways. When the **Charges codes** are configured in **Accounts payable** with either of the following:

-   The **Debit Type** is set to Item and the **Credit Type** is set to Ledger account. In this example, the ledger account selected as the absorption account acts as a stock variation account.
-   The **Debit Type** is set to Item and the **Credit Type** is set to Customer/Vendor. In this example, the charge will be accounted as material cost, and the stock variation account of the item will be used.

## European special accounting rule

In Europe, the Post to charge account accounting principle is commonly used for incorporating a special accounting rule. For example, there are two common ways one can account for inventory changes.

The first method is referred to as the "cost of sales method". This approach is supported with standard inventory posting profile configuration without the Post to charge account option.

The second method is referred to as the "nature of expense" method. It is very common that smaller organizations follow this process, which typically involves the following steps.

1.  At the time goods or services are received, they are fully expensed.
2.  At the end of the period, a cycle count is performed.
3.  A manual adjustment is posted for the quantity and value into inventory. The offset account is a stock variation account that offsets the expense posted in the first step. As a result, you only see the variation in the stock value on this account.

By making use of the post to charge account principle one can fully automate the two postings, which eliminates a manual period end closing adjustment posting.

## Enable the post to charge account accounting principle

To enable the post to charge account accounting principle, follow these steps.
