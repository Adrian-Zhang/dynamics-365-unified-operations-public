# Fixed receipt price

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

*Fixed receipt price* is an option you can select on an **Item model group** when you use an **Inventory model** other than *Standard cost* or *Moving weighted average*. This option was referred to as *Standard cost* in early versions of Dynamics AX and was renamed to *Fixed receipt price* in Dynamics AX 2012 when the new standard cost inventory model was introduced. This topic explains how you can configure and use fixed receipt prices in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## About fixed receipt price

When you select the **Fixed receipt price** check box on the **Item model group** page for an item, the system will use the receipt price as a standard cost for the inventory receipt. If there is a difference between the purchase price and the default item cost price configured for a product, the difference will be posted to the **Fixed receipt price profit** or **Fixed receipt price loss** account and offset to the **Fixed receipt price offset** account that you specify on the **Inventory posting profile** page.

Because this option is used in conjunction with different inventory models such as FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average, the *Inventory close and adjustment* process will still create settlements and adjustments according to the inventory principle that you select on the **Item model group**; however, adjustments are only made to issues from inventory.

For example, suppose you have configured a product with an **Item model group** that has the **Inventory model** set to *FIFO* and the **Fixed receipt price** option selected. When you receive inventory through a purchase order, the inventory value is set to the value of the item's default cost price at time of product receipt. Later, when you invoice the purchase order, if the invoice price is different, the system will post the default cost price on the released product to the inventory account and will post the difference to the fixed receipt price profit or loss account. Later, when you sell or consume the product, the system will use the running average for the item at the time of posting the sales order invoice (unless you use marking).

When you run the *Inventory close and adjustment* process, the system will create a settlement with the first issue against the first receipt. The difference between the receipt price that was used on the receipt and the running average that was used on the issue is posted in a new voucher.

## Enable fixed receipt price

To enable fixed receipt prices for an item, follow these steps:

1. Open **Inventory management \> Setup \> Inventory \> Item model groups**.
2. Create a new item model group or select an existing model group.
3. On the **Costing method & cost recognition** FastTab, select the **Fixed receipt price** check box.
4. Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't select the **Fixed receipt price** check box if the **Inventory model** field is set to *Standard* cost or *Moving average*.

After enabling the **Fixed receipt price** option, you must update your inventory posting profile using the following steps:

1. Go to **Inventory management \> Setup \> Posting \> Posting**.
1. Open the **Purchase order** tab.
1. In the **Select** column, select **Fixed receipt price profit**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a new row to the grid. Set up the new row to apply to the item model group for which you enabled fixed receipt pricing, and identify the **Main account** for recording fixed receipt price profit for purchase orders. Make other settings as needed.
1. In the **Select** column, select **Fixed receipt price loss**. As previously, add a new row that applies to the item model group for which you enabled fixed receipt pricing, and identify the **Main account** for recording fixed receipt price losses for purchase orders. Make other settings as needed.
1. In the **Select** column, select **Fixed receipt price offset**. As previously, add new row to apply to the item model group for which you enabled fixed receipt pricing, and identify the **Main account** for recording fixed receipt price offsets for purchase orders. Make other settings as needed.
1. Open the **Inventory** tab.
1. In the **Select** column, select **Fixed receipt price profit**.  As previously, add new row to apply to the item model group for which you enabled fixed receipt pricing, and identify the **Main account** for recording fixed receipt price profit for inventory. Make other settings as needed.
1. In the **Select** column, select **Fixed receipt price loss**. As previously, add a new row that applies to the item model group for which you enabled fixed receipt pricing, and identify the **Main account** for recording fixed receipt price losses for inventory. Make other settings as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> We usually recommend that the **Fixed receipt price profit** and **Fixed receipt price loss** fields use the same **Main account** for both purchase orders and inventory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you change the value in the **Price** field on the **Manage costs** FastTab on the **Released products** page, the system does not automatically revalue the inventory that is on hand. As a manual work around, open the **Closing and adjustment** page and select **Adjustment \> On-hand** on the Action Pane. Then select the items that are on hand and adjust them to the current price. One clear advantage to using the standard cost inventory model is that it causes the system will automatically revalue the on-hand inventory.
