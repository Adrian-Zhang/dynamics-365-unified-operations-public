# Fixed receipt price

Fixed receipt price is an option you can select on an **Item model group** when you use an **Inventory model** other than Standard cost or Moving weighted average. This option was referred to as standard cost in early versions of Dynamics AX and was renamed to **Fixed receipt price** in Dynamics AX 2012 when the new Standard cost inventory model was introduced. This article explains how you can configure and use Fixed receipt prices in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## About fixed receipt price

When you select the **Fixed receipt price** check box on the **Item model group** page for an item, the system will use receipt price as a standard cost for the inventory receipt. If there is a difference between the purchase price and the default item cost price configured for a product, the difference will be posted to the **Fixed receipt price profit** or **Fixed receipt price** **loss** account and offset to the **Fixed receipt price offset** account that you specify on the **Inventory posting profile** page.

Because this option is used in conjunction with different inventory models such as FIFO, LIFO, or Weighted average, the **Inventory close and adjustment** process will still create settlements and adjustments according to the inventory principle that you select on the **Item model group**; however, adjustments are only made to issues from inventory.

For example, you configure a product with an **Item model group** with the **Inventory model** set to FIFO and the **Fixed receipt price** option selected. When you receive inventory through a purchase order, the inventory value is set to the value of the item's default cost price at time of product receipt. Later when you invoice the purchase order if the invoice price is different, the system will post the default cost price on the released product to the inventory account and the difference is posted to the Fixed receipt price profit or loss account. Later when you sell or consume the product the system will use the running average for the item at the time of posting the sales order invoice (unless you use marking).

When you run the **Inventory close and adjustment** process, the system, will create a settlement with the first issue against the first receipt. The difference between the receipt price that was used on the receipt and the running average that was used on the issue is posted in a new voucher.

## Enable fixed receipt price

To enable fixed receipt prices for an item, follow these steps.

1.  Open **Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Inventory &gt; Item model groups**.
2.  Create a new item model group or select an existing model group.
3.  Select the **Fixed receipt price** check box in the **Cost price** group.
4.  Close the page.

> [!NOTE]
> ** You cannot select the **Fixed receipt price** check box if the **Inventory model** field is set to Standard cost or Moving average.

After you enable the **Fixed receipt price** option, you need to configure the following accounts on the **Inventory posting profile** page.

-   Purchase order tab:
    -   Fixed receipt price profit
    -   Fixed receipt price loss
    -   Fixed receipt price offset

-   Inventory tab:
    -   Fixed receipt price profit
    -   Fixed receipt price loss

> [!NOTE]
> It is typically recommended that the Fixed receipt price profit and loss fields use the same main account for both purchases and inventory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you change the value in the **Price** field on the **Manage costs** FastTab in the **Released products** page, the system does not automatically revalue the inventory that is on hand. You can use the **Adjustment** **&gt; On-hand** button in the **Closing and adjustment** page to select all items that are on hand and adjust them to the current price as a manual work around. This is one clear advantage to using the Standard cost inventory model as the system will automatically revalue the on-hand inventory.
