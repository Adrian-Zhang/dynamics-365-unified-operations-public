# Inventory Visibility Service Overview
  
The Inventory Visibility Add-in (also referred to as Inventory Visibility Service) is an independent and highly scalable microservice that enables real-time on-hand inventory change posting and visibility tracking across all your data sources and channels. It provides you a platform of global inventory that empowers you to have a smart control of your global inventory such as but not restricted to:
- Track centrally the latest inventory status such as onhand, ordered, purchased, in-transit, returned, quarantined, etc. across all of your datasources, warehouse and locations by connecting your D365 SCM or 3PL data sources (OMS, 3PL ERPs, POS, WMS, etc.) to inventory visibility services
- Check onhand stock availability/shortage and obtain immediate response by calling inventory visibility service directly
- Avoid oversell especially when your demand comes from different channels by real-time Soft-reserve in inventory visibility service

## Extensibility
  Inventory Visibility Service is highly extensible as the data input and output are not restricted to Microsoft applications. External systems can access the service through RESTful APIs. In addition to current out-of-box mappings with D365 supply chain management datasource and dimensions, you can integrate Inventory Visibility with multiple third-party systems by setting up additional datasource, inventory statuses measures (called physical measures in inventory visibility service) and inventory dimensions via the configuration app. In that way, you can query and make changes to your multiple datasources and pre-defined inventory dimensions flexibly.

  Additionally, as a microservice that is built on Microsoft Dataverse, Inventory Visibility service data can be leveraged to integrate and build power apps. You can also apply Power BI to provide customized dashboards that meet your business requirements.
## Scalability
As an inventory data performance engine, inventory visibility service can be scaled up or down depending on your organizationâ€™s data volume. The scalability experience is seamless and is conducted by Microsoft platform team based on automatic detection and assessment of your transaction data volume. For details about platfrom scalbility please refer to xxxx.
