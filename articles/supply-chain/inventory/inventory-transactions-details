## Fields on the General FastTab

The following table describes the fields on the **General** FastTab that aren't also shown on the **Inventory transactions** page.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Party | Shows the name of the relevant party for the current inventory transaction. For example, a purchase order transaction would show the name of the vendor on the purchase order and a sales order transaction would show the customer. This field is not available for all types of inventory transactions. |
| Inventory reference | Identifies the type of another inventory transaction that is related to the current inventory transaction. For example, if a purchase order is marked against a sales order, the purchase order transaction's **Inventory reference** would be *Sales order*. Marking occurs automatically for direct deliver orders and intercompany orders. When you use marking with costing methods other than *standard cost* or *moving average*, the system will create settlements and adjustments to the exact transactions that are marked. In this way you can achieve "actual" costing that overrides the logic for FIFO, LIFO, or weighted average. |
| Inventory number | This field identifies the specific transaction that is related to the current inventory transaction. For example, if a purchase order is marked against a sales order, the purchase order transaction's **Inventory number** would be the sales order number. |
| Project ID | If the current inventory transaction is related to a project, this field shows the project number. |
| Lot ID | Shows the unique lot ID that Supply Chain Management has assigned to the current inventory transaction. |
| Reference lot | Shows the lot ID of another inventory transaction that is related to the current inventory transaction. For example, if a purchase order is marked against a sales order, the purchase order transaction's **Reference lot** would be the **Lot ID** of the sales order line's inventory transaction. |
| Dimension number | Shows a unique ID that represents the combination of all the inventory dimension values assigned to the current inventory transaction. |
| Value open | Indicates whether the current inventory transaction has been settled by the inventory closing process. If **Value open** is *Yes*, the transaction has not been settled. |
| Expected date | For receipt transactions, this is the date the inventory receipt is expected to occur. For example, the **Expected date** could show the expected receipt date on an inventory blocking order or the delivery date on a purchase order line. |
| Inventory date | This field is populated when a registration transaction has been done on the receipt order prior to posting a physical receipt. |
| Non-financial transfer | Shows whether the current inventory transaction is a non-financial transfer. A non-financial transfer occurs when a change in inventory dimensions isn't tracked financially on the **Item model group** page. |
