# Inventory transaction details

You can view the details of an inventory transaction when you click the **Transaction details** button in the **Inventory transactions** page.

The **Transactions details** page is split into several FastTabs. The following table describes the information in each FastTab.

The following table describes the fields that are displayed in the **General** FastTab that are not included in the **Inventory transactions** page.

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Party                  | Shows the name from the party record. For example, a purchase order would show the name of the vendor on the purchase order and a sales order would show the customer. This field is not available for all inventory transaction types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Inventory reference    | This field is used to identify the type of inventory transaction that is related to the inventory transaction. For example, if a purchase order is marked against the sales order, the purchase orders' inventory reference would be "Purchase order". Marking occurs automatically for direct deliver orders and intercompany orders. When you use marking with costing methods other than Standard cost and Moving average, the system will create settlements and adjustments to the exact transactions that are marked. In this way you can achieve "actual" costing that overrides the logic for FIFO, LIFO, or Weighted average. |
| Inventory number       | This field is used to identify the unique number of the transaction that is related to the inventory transaction. For example, if a purchase order is marked against the sales order, the purchase orders' inventory reference would be the exact sales order number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Project ID             | If an inventory transaction is related to a project, you can view the project number in the Project ID field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Lot ID                 | The Lot ID is the unique ID that is assigned by Dynamics 365 to each inventory transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Reference lot          | This field is used to identify the unique number of the transaction that is related to the inventory transaction. For example, if a purchase order is marked against the sales order, the purchase orders' inventory reference would be the Lot ID of the sales order line's inventory transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Dimension number       | This is a unique ID that represents the combination of inventory dimensions assigned to the inventory transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Value open             | Used to indicate if the inventory transaction has been settled by the inventory closing process. When the value open is "yes" the transaction has not been settled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Expected date          | For receipt transactions, this is the date the inventory receipt is expected to happen. For example, expected date can be filled by the expected receipt date on an inventory blocking order or the delivery date on a purchase order line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Inventory date         | This field gets populated when there is a registration transaction done on the receipt order prior to posting a physical receipt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Non-financial transfer | Indicates if the inventory is a non-financial transfer. This happens when there is a change in inventory dimensions that is not tracked financially on the Item model group page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Transfer lot ID        | If a transaction is a non-financial transfer, indicates the Lot ID of the other inventory transaction this transaction is settled against.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
