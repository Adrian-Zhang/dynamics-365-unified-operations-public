# Commercial Invoice

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This article describes how to create commercial invoice when using warehouse management processes (WMS).  

A commercial invoice is a required document for the export and import clearance process. A commercial invoice is used to calculate tariffs, international commercial terms, and is commonly used for customs purposes. Commercial Invoices are generally not needed for shipments between EU Countriesâ€”just between EU Countries and non-EU Countries. A few countries require the commercial invoice to be on a specific form, but for most countries, the seller or exporters version is acceptable as long as all the pertinent information is included.   

You can print the document for a single shipment from the **All shipments** list page or from the **Shipment details** page.

Depending on the document print selection, the document can be pre-filled with data from your system. It is possible to change or add data to the printed document by exporting the printed document to an editable format, such as Microsoft Word. After export, you can apply any required changes before a declaration is made.

## Document content

The commercial invoice document contains the following data elements:
  - Invoice No and Date
  - Seller 
  - Sold to address
  - Ship to address
  - IncoTerm
  - Payment Term
  - Currency of settlement
  - Mode of Shipment
  - Product Detail: include quantity, description, UoM, Unit Price, Total Price
  - Total Commercail Value
  - Misc. Charges
  - Total Invoice Value
