## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

If you want to turn any of these features on or off, you must do that in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

| Module | Feature name in feature management | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Master planning | Consider inventory lead time when creating a planned transfer order | When a planned transfer order is created, this feature causes the system to consider the inventory lead time specified in the item's default order settings when calculating the receipt date of the planned transfer order for delivery date control setup as *None* or *Sales* lead time. When transfer lead time is specified, its value will be taken for the receipt date calculation and transport days will be disregarded. <!-- KFM: This description isn't clear. --> |
| Procurement and sourcing | Default broker contract tax information on vendor invoice lines | This feature introduces logic to set default values for the **Sales tax** and **Item sales tax** fields in broker contract vendor invoice lines. This logic is only applied when the charge type on the broker contract line is ledger/ledger. The item sales tax group will take its default value from the brokerage procurement category (if set up) or from the charge type. The sales tax group will take its default value from the vendor account. |
| Procurement and sourcing | Limit the number of purchase order lines per batch task | This feature helps you to optimize system performance when posting confirmations and product receipts. It adds a new setting called **Lines per task** to the **Delivery** tab of the **Procurement and sourcing parameters** page. The new setting lets you limit the number of purchase order lines processed by each batch task, which helps prevent large batch tasks from slowing down the system. |
| Product information management | Populate product attribute values | This feature adds a periodic task called *Populate product attribute values*, which creates missing product attribute value records for attributes associated with products via a product category. |
| Production control | Additional configuration on the production floor execution interface | This feature adds the following options to the **Configure production floor execution** page:<ul><li>**Auto-open start dialog when completing search** – When this option is enabled, the **Start job** dialog is automatically opened when workers use the search bar to find the job.</li><li>**Auto-open report progress dialog when completing search** – When this option is enabled, the **Report progress** dialog for the job will be automatically opened when workers use the search bar to find the job.</li><li>**Default remaining quantity in the report progress dialog** – When this option is enabled, the system will show the remaining quantity to report on a production job on the **Report progress** dialog.</li></ul><p>For more information, see [Configure the production floor execution interface](../production-control/production-floor-execution-configure.md).</p> |
| Production control | "My day" view for the production floor execution interface | This feature enables the production floor execution interface to provide a **My day** view for each worker. The **My day** view lets each worker track their daily registrations of time spent on various types of activities such as work, breaks, and absence. The **My day** view also shows the worker the current balance on time spent on various activities and also the balance for the period. |
| Production control | Production teams in the production floor execution interface | When multiple workers are assigned to the same production job, they can now nominate one worker as a pilot, and the remaining workers will automatically become assistants to that pilot. For the resulting team, only the pilot needs to register job status, while time records apply to all team members. This feature also supports a scenario called *assist resource*, where a worker can register as an assistant to another worker, who then becomes the pilot for the newly formed group.<br><br>For more information, see [How workers use the production floor execution interface](../production-control/production-floor-execution-use.md) |
| Production control | Report on planning items in the production floor execution interface | This feature simplifies the process of reporting on batch orders for planning items on the production floor execution interface. When a batch order is created for a product with production type *Planning item*, it's only possible to report as finished on the co-products and by-products for that batch order. Batch orders for planning items are typically used to support disassembly processes, where a raw material product is disassembled into multiple distinct products. When reporting as finished a batch order for a planning item, workers will now only see the co-products and by-products in the report progress dialog. Previously, the planning item was also shown, which could confuse workers. |

### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) topic describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
