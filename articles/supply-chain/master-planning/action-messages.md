# Action messages

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An action message is a system-generated suggestion to change an existing planned, approved, or firmed order.

Action messages are generated by the master planning calculation in response to changed requirements. For example, the ship date or quantity may have changed on a sales order for which you have already created a purchase order to fulfill the demand. In this case, one or more action messages are generated by the master planning calculation to update the purchase order. You decide whether to make the changes that are suggested.

You can set up how action messages are calculated for a coverage group that you attach to an item.

## Select action messages

On the **Coverage groups** page, you can select the action messages that you want the system to generate, and the coverage groups or items that the messages apply to. The following table lists the action message you can select.

| Message | Description |
|---|---|
| **Advance** | The system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to an earlier date. In the **Advance margin** field, you can also specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without advance action. |
| **Postpone** | The system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to a later date. In the **Postpone margin** field, you can specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without postpone action. |
| **Decrease** | The system will generate action messages when production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be decreased to prevent excess inventory levels. |
| **Increase** | The system will generate action messages when production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be increased to prevent shortages in inventory. |
| **Derived actions** | Action messages created for receipt transactions will be propagated to any derived requirements and the necessary action messages will be generated for the receipt transactions satisfying them. |

The following sections provide a few detailed scenarios.

## Increase and decrease actions with product default order quantities

On the **Default order settings** page for an item, you can set up a minimum order quantity, maximum order quantity, and multiple values. When actions are suggested for items with these values set, the system will provide suggestions that ensure the action calculation quantity will never lead to undersupply.

As an example, suppose you an an item that has the following settings on its **Default order settings** page:

- **Minimum order quantity:** *0*
- **Maximum order quantity:** *90*
- **Multiple:** *20*

If there is a demand for quantity 60 of this item, master planning will create a planned purchase order of quantity 60. If demand is increased by 30, master planning will suggest an increase of 40 because it will respect the multiple of 20 and never lead to undersupply.

## Actions for orders related to safety stock

Actions for orders supplying safety stock will never suggest decreasing the quantity below the quantity needed for the safety stock. In other words, given an order that is supplying safety stock and customer demand, if the demand is decreased or cancelled, master planning will suggest decreasing the planned order by the decreased demand, but will never suggest a value lower than the needed safety stock.

The system won't suggest postponing actions for supplying safety stock because it is assumed that the safety stock must be supplied on the required time and date.

### Advance and postpone actions related to BOMs

Actions related to components of bills of material (BOMs) must be applied before the actions of their parent items because further orders related to higher level BOMs may be affected. Then you must run master planning again to recalculate and suggest appropriate actions accordingly.

Suppose you have the following situation:

- Final good *FG* of type *production* has a BOM that includes the raw material *RM*.
- Today's date is Jan 21.
- A sales order for FG is created today (Jan 21).
- Master planning creates a production order for FG for Jan 25.  <!-- KFM: To cover the sales order? Is this really the date you mean? -->
- Jan 21 is closed for the RM calendar, but Jan 20 and Jan 22 are open

When master planning is run, it will generate advance actions that suggest the following:

- Move the production order to Jan 21 (without considering the closed date for RM).
- A BOM line for RM for Jan 21. <!-- KFM: What does this mean? -->
- Move the planned purchase order for RM to Jan 22 (respecting the calendar but not advancing to earlier than Jan 21).

Therefore, you must apply the action on the purchase order for RM first and then run master planning, which will suggest to postpone the production order to Jan 22. <!-- KFM: But it's already set for Jan 25? -->
