# Action messages

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An action message is a system-generated suggestion to change an existing planned, approved, or firmed order.

Action messages are generated by the master planning calculation in response to changed requirements. For example, the ship date or quantity may have changed on a sales order for which you have already created a purchase order to fulfill the demand. In this case, the master planning calculation generates one or more action messages suggesting that you update the purchase order. You decide whether to make the changes that are suggested.

You can set up how action messages are calculated for a coverage group that you attach to an item.

## Select action messages

On the **Coverage groups** page, you can select the action messages that you want the system to generate, and the coverage groups or items that the messages apply to. The following table lists the action message you can select.

| Message | Description |
|---|---|
| **Advance** | The system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to an earlier date. In the **Advance margin** field, you can also specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without advance action. |
| **Postpone** | The system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to a later date. In the **Postpone margin** field, you can specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without postpone action. |
| **Decrease** | The system will generate action messages when production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be decreased to prevent excess inventory levels. |
| **Increase** | The system will generate action messages when production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be increased to prevent shortages in inventory. |
| **Derived actions** | Action messages created for receipt transactions will be propagated to any derived requirements and the necessary action messages will be generated for the receipt transactions satisfying them. |

The following sections provide a few detailed scenarios.

## Increase and decrease actions with product default order quantities

On the **Default order settings** page for an item, you can set up a minimum order quantity, maximum order quantity, and multiple values. The system takes these settings into account when suggesting actions, which helps ensure that the suggestions will never lead to undersupply.

As an example, suppose you have an item that has the following settings on its **Default order settings** page:

- **Minimum order quantity:** *0*
- **Maximum order quantity:** *90*
- **Multiple:** *20*

If there's a demand for quantity 60 of this item, master planning will create a planned purchase order of quantity 60. If demand is increased by 30, master planning will suggest an increase of 40 because it will respect the multiple of 20 and never lead to undersupply.

## Action messages for orders related to safety stock

Action messages for orders supplying safety stock will never suggest decreasing the quantity below the quantity needed for the safety stock. In other words, given an order that is supplying safety stock and customer demand, if the demand is decreased or canceled, master planning will suggest decreasing the planned order by the decreased demand, but will never suggest a value lower than the needed safety stock.

The system won't suggest postponing actions for supplying safety stock because it's assumed that the safety stock must be supplied on the required time and date.

### Advance and postpone actions related to BOMs

Actions related to components of bills of material (BOMs) must be applied before the actions of their parent items because further orders related to higher level BOMs may be affected. Then you must run master planning again to recalculate and suggest appropriate actions accordingly.

For example, suppose you have the following situation:

- Final good *FG* of type *production* has a BOM that includes the raw material *RM*.
- Today's date is January 21.
- There is an existing, released production order for *FG* for January 25.
- To support the existing production order, master planning has created a planned purchase order for the required *RM*, also with a requirement date of January 25.
- A new sales order for *FG* is created today, with a requirement date of today (January 21).
- January 21 is closed for delivery on the *RM* calendar, but January 22 is open.

When master planning runs, it generates advance action messages suggesting that you move up the already scheduled production so you can fulfil today's order.

- To meet the new demand, it suggests to move the production order for *FG* up to January 21 (it makes this suggestion without considering the closed date for *RM*).
- The raw material *RM* is still required for the production order, so it suggests to advance the planned purchase order too. But this time it checks the *RM* calendar and therefore suggests moving the planned purchase order for *RM* to January 22 (because January 21 is closed).

As you can see, the required raw material *RM* will now arrive too late for the scheduled production of *FG*. Therefore, you must apply the advance action to the planned purchase order for *RM* first and then run master planning again, which will generate a new action message that suggests postponing the production order for *FG* to January 22.
