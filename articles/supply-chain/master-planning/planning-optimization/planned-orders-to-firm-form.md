## View, manage, and firm planned orders

This form allows access to the new Planned orders to firm form primarily designed for firming functionality. The form will show all planned orders generated for the selected plan just like the regular planned orders form, and as such can be used as a more optimized alternative to view results of the master planning run.

The form can be utilized to 
- See all planned orders per particular plan
- Create new planned orders
- Delete single or multiple planned orders
- Firm single or multiple planned orders
- Change planned order status for a single or multiple planned orders
- Seamlessly navigate to planned order details on individual planned order to see full details of the order
- Create custom views with saved views 

Additional scenarios, like split, are supported with the Planned orders form.
