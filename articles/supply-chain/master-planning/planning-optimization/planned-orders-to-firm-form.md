This topic describes how to view, manage, and firm planned orders with the **Planned orders to firm** page.

The **Planned orders to firm** page is a simplified version of the **Planned orders** page. It provides fewer options but is faster to work with when all you need to do is review, approve, and firm your planned orders.

## Turn on this feature for your system

If your system doesn't already include the features described in this topic, go to [Feature management](../../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) and turn on the *Enable Planned orders to firm* feature.

## View, manage, and firm planned orders

The **Planned orders to firm** page is primarily designed for firming functionality. It shows all planned orders generated for the selected plan, just like the standard **Planned orders** page does, and can therefore be used as an optimized alternative for viewing results of the master planning run.

To find the **Planned orders to firm** page go to **Master planning > Master planning > Planned orders to firm**. You can use this page to:

- See all planned orders per particular plan.
- Create new planned orders.
- Delete single or multiple planned orders.
- Firm single or multiple planned orders.
- Change planned order status for single or multiple planned orders.
- Seamlessly navigate to planned order details on individual planned order to see full details of the order.
- Create custom views with saved views.

Additional scenarios (like split) are supported by the **Planned orders** page.
