# Action messages

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

An action message is a system-generated suggestion to change an existing planned, approved or firmed order. 

## Introduction

Action messages are generated by the master planning calculation in response to changed requirements. For example, the ship date or quantity may have changed on a sales order for which you have already created a purchase order to fulfill the demand. In this case, one or multiple action messages are generated by the master planning calculation to update the purchase order. You decide whether to make the changes that are suggested.

You can set up how action messages are calculated for a coverage group that you attach to an item.

## Select action messages

On the **Coverage groups** page, you can select the action messages that you want the system to generate, and the coverage groups or items that the messages apply to. You can select the following action messages.

| Message             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Advance**         | If you select this message, the system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to an earlier date. In the **Advance margin** field, you can also specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without advance action. |
| **Postpone**        | If you select this message, the system will generate action messages, when needed, to move orders to a later date. In the **Postpone margin** field, you can specify the maximum number of days between receipt and issue without postpone action.       |
| **Decrease**        | If you select this message, production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be decreased to prevent excess inventory levels.                                                                                                   |
| **Increase**        | If you select this message, production orders, purchase orders, and other receipt transactions should be increased to prevent shortages in inventory.                                                                                                    |
| **Derived actions** | If you select this message, action messages created for receipt transactions will be propagated to any derived requirements and the necessary action messages will be generated for the receipt transactions satisfying them                                                                                   |

In the following sections, detailed scenarios will be explained further. 

## Increase and decrease actions with product default order quantities
On the default order settings of the item it is possible to setup a minimum order quantity, maximum order quantity and multiple values. 
When actions are suggested for items with these values setup, the suggestion will be so that the action calculation quantity will never lead to undersupply. 
As an example, let’s consider the following scenario:
Minimum order quantity = 0
Maximum order quantity = 90
Multiple = 20
There is a demand of the item for quantity 60. When running master planning, it will create a planned purchase order of quantity 60. 
If demand is increased by 30, when running master planning, then it will suggest an increase of 40 as it will respect the multiple of 20 and never lead to undersupply. 

## Actions for orders related to safety stock
Actions suggested for orders supplying for safety stock will never suggest decreasing the quantity below the quantity needed for the safety stock. In other words, given an order that is supplying for safety stock and customer demand, if the demand is decreased or cancelled, master planning will suggest decreasing the planned order by the decreased demand, and never to a lower value than the needed safety stock. 
Postpone actions for supplying safety stock will not be suggested, as it is understood that the safety stock must be supplied on the required time and date.

### Advance and postpone actions related to BOM
Actions in components of a BOM must be applied before the actions of their parent items as further orders related to the higher level BOMs may be affected. Then, master planning must be run again to recalculate and suggest appropriate actions accordingly.
Let’s see an example of advance actions with calendar days: 
-	A final good FG of production type and with a BOM where the raw material RM is used. 
-	Sales order for FG on 1/21
-	Today’s date is 1/21
-	When running master planning, a production order is created for FG on 1/25. 
-	1/21 is closed for the RM calendar, but 1/20 and 1/22 are open
When master planning is run, it will generate advance actions for:
-	The production order to 1/21 (without considering the closed date for RM)
-	The BOM line (RM) to 1/21
-	The planned purchase order for RM to 1/22 (respecting calendar but not advancing to earlier than 1/21)
Therefore, user must apply the action on the purchase order for RM first. And then run master planning, which will suggest to postpone the production order to 1/22.
