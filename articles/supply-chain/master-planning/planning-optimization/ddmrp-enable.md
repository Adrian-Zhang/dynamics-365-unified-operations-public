# Turn on the DDMRP feature for your system

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

Before you can use DDMRP functionality, it must be turned on for your system together with its prerequisite feature. Admins can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) settings to check the status of these features and turn them on. Turn on the following features:

- **Feature name:** *Priority driven MRP support for Planning Optimization*
- **Feature name:** *(Preview) DDMRP for Planning Optimization*

<!-- KFM: Is the first feature name correct? The prerequisite isn't enforced by the system--is it really needed? -->
