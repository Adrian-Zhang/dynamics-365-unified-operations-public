1. Select the **All** tab.
1. Use the **Filter** field to search for the feature called *Sensor Data Intelligence*.
1. If the *Sensor Data Intelligence* feature is enabled on your system, select it in the list and then select **Disable** to disable it. (You can't use this older version of the feature together with the new preview version that you will enable in the next step.)
