# Quality updates 

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Over the last several years, we have made continuous progress on what we refer to as One Version. The premise of One Version is simple – the closer that we can get to having all customers operating on the same software version, the higher the quality that we can deliver. We find and fix issues once, and we get those solutions in the hands of more customers more quickly. We see the results that confirm this with lower incident counts across our products. When we are not on the same version, we consistently see customers impacted by issues where the solution is already available. We’ve made great progress already with Dynamics 365 Finance, Supply Chain, Project Operations and Commerce, and thanks to recent technical advances, it’s now possible to take the next step. The following lays out what we’re going to do, what we’ve already done to set the stage, and how and when we will introduce the new capabilities without disruption.
