## What are Business events?
Business events are generated by Dynamics 365 applications when something interesting happens in a business process, such as posting of an invoice. Business events are also generated by Microsoft Dataverse and the Power platform, the platform underneath Dynamics 365 products. External applications can consume business events and trigger actions. For mroe on Business events, see **Business events generated by Microsoft Dataverse [here]**(https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/data-platform/business-events)  

Export to Data lake service generates Business events when data transfer activites are complete or when an issue is encountered. Using Business events, you can create automated actions to respond to these events. We refer to these actions as **Business actions**.

## Generated events
Export to Data lake service generates several events. Note that this feature is currently in preview and not all events may be generated during the preview. 

- **Initialize complete** indicates that initialization for a (selected) table is complete. When you choose a table to be activated, the system makes an initial copy of the data in the Data lake. If you have not selected the "Near real time data changes (preview)" feature, the system will periodically initialize data in the lake. The system may auto-initialize selected tables in case it encounteres a service operation in Finance an operation such as a database restore. In either of these scenarios, system generates Initialize complete events. If you have multiple tables enabled in the environment, you will get multiple business events as and when each table completes initialization. 

-  **Metadata changed** indicates that table metadata has changed. You will get multiple events, one for each metadata change **this event is not yet implemented**  

-   **Deactivated** indicates that a previously active table has been deactivated. This means, changes to data in Finance and Operations are not updated in the lake. **this event is not yet implemented**

-   **Activated** indicates that a previously deactivated table has been reactivated. Once a table is reactivated, system reinializes data in the lake. You may receive an "Initialize complete" event subsequently. **this event is not yet implemented**

-   **Error** indicates that Export to Data lake service has paused updating data in the lake, **this event is not yet implemented**

-   **Lake switch** indicates that the location of the data lake has been changed by the system administrator. **this event is not yet implemented**

## Enable Business Actions 
If you are using Export to Data lake add-in in Finance and Operations, Business events are already enabled in your environment. You need to install the **Dynamics 365 Export to Data lake** solution in your Power platform environment to take action when Business events are generated by the system.

To install the **Dynamics 365 Export to Data lake** solution, you need to launch Power platform admin center. You need to be an administrator in the Power platform environment.

1. launch Power platform admin center and select ..
2. Choose 
3. Select the application
4. Business events feature in Export to Data lake service is in preview. By choosing to install the application, you you agree to the [Supplemental Terms of Use](../../fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-terms.md)

## Create a Busines action
You can create an action using Microsoft Power Automate, Azure messaging services such as Logic Apps as well as many third party tools. For simplicity, we will discuss creating a Business action using the Power Automate Dataverse connector trigger [When an action is performed (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/#when-an-action-is-performed-(preview)).

The event message schemas are defined as below:
