## What are business events?
Business events are generated by Dynamics 365 applications when something interesting happens in a business process, such as the posting of an invoice. Business events are also generated by Microsoft Dataverse and the Power Platform, the platform underneath Dynamics 365 products. External applications can consume business events and trigger actions. For more information on business events, see [Microsoft Dataverse business events](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/business-events).  

The Export to Data Lake service generates business events when data transfer activites are complete or when an issue is encountered. Using business events, you can create automated actions to respond to these events. For example, if you have an automated data pipeline that continuosMicrosoft Dataverse business eventsly copies changed data rows from Data lake to another location, you may need to take special actions when, say, a table has been deactivated or has been re-activated. As opposed to processing changed rows, you may want to trigger a full copy operation in response.  

You can listen to business events that are interesting, and create automatic triggers and respond to business events as they happen. We refer to these automated actions as **business actions**. It is not necessary that you listen to all business events. You can listen and react to only the business events that are interesting.  

## Business events generated by the Export to Data Lake service
The Export to Data Lake service generates several business events. Note that this feature is currently in preview and not all events may be generated during the preview. 

- **Initialize complete** indicates that initialization for a (selected) table is complete. When you choose a table to be activated, the system makes an initial copy of the data in the data lake. If you have not selected the **Near real-time data changes (preview)** feature, the system will periodically initialize data in the lake. The system may auto-initialize selected tables in case it encounteres a service operation in Finance and Operation apps, such as a database restore. In either of these scenarios, the system generates **Initialize complet** events. If you have multiple tables enabled in the environment, you will get multiple business events when each table completes initialization. 

-  **Metadata changed** indicates that table metadata has changed. For example, a new column has been added to the table, or (in more rare cases) a column has been deleted. You will get multiple events for each table, one for each metadata change. If you have downstream data pipelines that can't react to metadata changes (also known as "schema drift"), you can detect changes using these events and modify dowstream pipelines.

-   **Deactivated** indicates that a previously active table has been deactivated. This means changes to data in Finance and Operations apps are not updated in the lake.  

-   **Activated** indicates that a previously deactivated table has been reactivated. Once a table is reactivated, the system reinializes data in the lake. You may receive an **Initialize complete** event subsequently. 

-   **Error** indicates that the Export to Data Lake service has paused updating data in the lake.  

-   **Lake switch** indicates that the location of the data lake has been changed by the system administrator.

## Enable business events 
If you are using the Export to Data Lake add-in in Finance and Operations apps, business events are already enabled in your environment. You need to install the **Dynamics 365 Export to Data Lake** solution in your Power Platform environment to take action when business events are generated by the system.

To install the **Dynamics 365 Export to Data Lake** solution, you need to launch the Power Platform admin center. You need to be an administrator in the Power Platform environment. Locate the solution and choose **Install**. 

> [!NOTE]
> Business events featured in the Export to Data Lake service are in preview. By choosing to install the application, you you agree to the [Supplemental Terms of Use](../../fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-terms.md).

## Create a busines action
You can create an action using Microsoft Power Automate, Azure messaging services such as Logic Apps, as well as many third party tools. For simplicity, we will discuss creating a business action using the Power Automate Dataverse connector trigger [When an action is performed (preview)](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/#when-an-action-is-performed-(preview)).

Each business event provides an event message, which helps you identify the table impacted by the event. You can think of an event message as a parameter that can be passed into a business action. Business events and the event message schemas are defined as below:

| Business event                          | Description | Event message (parameters)                |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Initialize complete (preview)           | System completed full copy of a table.            | TableName: string, FolderPath: string |
| Metadata changed (preview)  | Table metadata changed.                           | TableName: string                    |
| Deactivated (preview)       | Table has been deactivated.                       | TableName: string                    |
| Activated (preview)         | Table has been activated.                         | TableName: string                    |
| Error  (Preview)            | Service has paused due to an error.              | TableName: string, StatusCode: int    |
| Lake switch   (not yet implemented)     | Data lake location has been changed.              |                                      |

To create a business action using Microsoft Power Automate:

1. Launch Microsoft Power Automate by choosing **Flows** from the **Power Apps maker portal**.
2. Select **My flows** in the **Power Automate** portal and select **New Flow**.
3. Choose **Automated Cloud flow** and choose **When an action is performed (preview)**.

![Create Automated Cloud Flow](/articles/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/media/NewAutomatedCloudFlow.png)

4. Choose **Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Export to Data Lake** as the cataog and **Data Export** as the category.
5. Leave the **Table name** field as **None**. This parameter is not applicable for the Export to Data Lake service.     
6. You can choose to create an action when any of the business events are fired. You can choose a business event from the table above. Choose the business event in the **Action name** field. In this case, we want an action performed when an **Error** happens in the service.

7. Add a new step, in this case to send an e-mail. You can choose to implement any step available in Power Automate. You can choose parameters such as Table Name when composing the e-mail message.
8. Save the flow. When a table goes into error status, you should get an e-mail.
