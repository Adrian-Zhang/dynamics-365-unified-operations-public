Data exported from Finance and Operations is stored in the lake as raw files
(ie. Comma separated files, or CSV files). In addition to data, rich metadata
stored in Finance and Operations application layer (ie. Application Object
Server, or AOS) is also available in Data lake. Having rich metadata enables you
to consume the data using client tools without having to work with raw files.
