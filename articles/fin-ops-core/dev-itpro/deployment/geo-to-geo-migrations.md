# Geo to geo migrations

Microsoft continues to open datacenters for business service in both existing and new regions. The Geo migration feature lets you move your environments in a single tenant from geography (or geo) to another geography. No user-interface or version changes occur part of this move.

When your tenant resides in a Microsoft 365 environment in a single tenant, moving the environment doesn't move the Microsoft 365 environment; they are separate services. Your environment will still appear in your tenant alongside the Microsoft 365 environment.

\*Important

- Support for Geo migration is limited, and generally isn't available.
- Create your support request at least 10 days in advance of when you would like the environment to migrate.
- Geo migrations are not supported into or out of sovereign cloud e.g., US GCC, China.
- Decide source and target geography based on availability of products in[local geographies](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/deployment-options-geo).
- Review availability of features in target geography
  - Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available services across geographies. We continue to evaluate these services and capabilities for inclusion and updates in future releases. Use the documents below to get an overview of services and their availability in the geographies you are planning to use.

  - [Microsoft Business Application Feature Availability - EMEA](https://aka.ms/bapfunctionalparityemea)
  - [Microsoft Business Application Feature Availability - APAC](https://aka.ms/bapfunctionalparityapac)
- For preview, migration is supported only within US, EU, Norway and UAE. Other local geographies will be made available once migration will be made publicly available.
- Microservices (add-ins) are not covered by the migration process. You will need to uninstall the add-ins prior to migration, and then re-install them post migration.
- If your environment being migrated has power platform integration enabled, then corresponding Dataverse organization will be migrated at the same time. If you do not wish to migrate the Dataverse Organization, then please mention that in the support request explicitly.
- To request a Geo migration, please contact your account manager and open a support ticket with the Microsoft team  [Technical Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs-support).
  - Provide details with Tenant ID, Environment ID, Source Geo, Target Geo, Preferred Date and time in support ticket
  - Technical support will notify customers about migration updates

## Supported environments

- Sandbox environments
- Production environments â€“ It is suggested to migrate Sandbox first and validate before triggering Production migration.

## Migration Process

The Geo migration process consists of 3 phases:

1. Premigration:
  - The environment is available for end-user use but is put into an Infrastructure Maintenance state so no Lifecycle managementoperations can be performed.
2. Migration:
  - The environment requires downtime of up to 48 hours and isn't available for use during this time.
  - The resources move to the new geography.
3. Postmigration:
  - The environment is available for use, and after confirmation you're your customers the environment is working as expected, cleanup operations are performed.
