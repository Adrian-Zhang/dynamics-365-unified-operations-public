# Change the SQL Server that your environment is using

This topic covers how you can upgrade the SQL Server that your environment is using. You will need to do this if you want to upgrade from one major version of SQL to another and don't want to do an in-place upgrade. Additionally, you may need to do this if you want to change the SQL instance or server for your environment.

## Prerequisites for upgrading the version of Microsoft SQL Server

### Upgrade from Microsoft SQL Server 2016 to Microsoft SQL Server 2019

Your environment must be on application version 10.0.21 or above. Additionally, the LocalAgent present in your environment also has to be on version 2.7.0 or higher.

## Preparation

1. Deploy your new SQL Server instance into a VM, or create a new cluster.

1. Ensure you configure the new instance or cluster according to our documentation [Set up SQL Server](./setup-deploy-on-premises-pu41.md#setupsql)

1. If you are using self-signed certificates ensure they have been imported into the nodes within the Service Fabric Cluster.

## Database operations

1. At this point ensure that users are not connected as your downtime will start.

1. Backup all of your databases from your current SQL Server instance or cluster.

1. Restore the database backups into the new SQL Server instance or cluster.

1. After restoring your databases run the scripts in [Configure the databases](./setup-deploy-on-premises-pu41.md#configuredb).

## 

1. All of your SQL Server components across an environment must be on the same version. As such, you should proceed to upgrade your SSIS and SSRS components.

## Update the Local Agent

1. Cleanup the Local Agent by running the following command from an orchestrator node:

    ```powershell
    LocalAgentCLI.exe Cleanup <path of localagent-config.json>
    ```

1. In [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com) update your connector configuration with the new FQDN of the SQL Server instance or cluster.

1. Download the new configuration file.

1. In the configuration file that was just download you have to update the SQL Server version that you are going to be deploying as detailed in [Deployment configurations for the local agent](./onprem-localagent-options.md)

    ```json
    "deploymentOptions": {
        ...
        },
        "sqlServerVersion" : {
            "value": "2019"
        },
        ...
    }
    ```

1. Install the local agent with the new config file.

    ```powershell
    LocalAgentCLI.exe Install <path of the new localagent-config.json>
    ```

## Update your environment settings

1. In [LCS](https://lcs.dynamics.com), click the "Full Details" link for the environment you want to update the SQL Server.

1. Select **Maintain** and then select **Update Settings**.

1. When updating the settings, update the FQDN of the new SQL Server instance or cluster.

1. Select **Prepare**.

1. After downloading and preparation is complete, the **Update environment** button will display.

1. The environment will now be redeployed and configured to interact with the new version of SQL Server.
