[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can send a generated document directly to a network printer for direct printing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must install and configure the Document Routing Agent, and then register the network printers. For more information, see [Install the Document Routing Agent to enable network printing](./install-document-routing-agent.md).

## Make the Printer destination available

To make the **Printer** destination available in the current instance of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, go to the **Feature management** workspace, and turn on the following features, in this order:

1. Convert Electronic Reporting outbound documents from Microsoft Office formats to PDF
2. Document Routing Agent as Electronic Reporting destination for outbound documents

### Applicability

#### PDF printing

In versions of Finance before version 10.0.18, the **Printer** destination can only be configured for file components that are used to generate output in printable PDF format (**PDF Merger** or **PDF file** format elements) or Microsoft Office Excel and Word format (**Excel file** format element). When the output is generated in PDF format, it's sent to a printer. When the output is generated in the Office format by using the **Excel file** format element, it's automatically converted to PDF format and then sent to a printer.

However, starting in version 10.0.18, you can configure the **Printer** destination for the **Common file** format element. Mostly, this format element is used to generate output in either TXT or XML formats. You can configure an ER format that contains the **Common file** format element as the root format element and the **Binary contents** format element that is only nested under the root format element. In this case, the **Common file** format element will produce an output in the format specified by the binding that you configure for the **Binary contents** format element. For example, you can configure this binding to [populate](tasks/er-document-management-files-5.md#modify-the-format-to-populate-attachments-into-generating-messages-in-binary-format) to this element the content of a [Document management](../../fin-ops/organization-administration/configure-document-management.md) attachment in PDF or Office (Excel or Word) format. You can print out such an output by using the configured **Printer** destination. 

> [!NOTE]
> Notice that when you select the **Common\File** format element to configure the **Printer** destination, the 
**Please, make sure that the output that is generated by selected format component can be converted to PDF. Otherwise, uncheck the 'Convert to PDF' option.** warning is thrown as it is not possible to guarantee at design time that the selected element will produce output in PDF or convertible to PDF format. So, you must control this to prevent runtime issues when non-PDF or non-PDF convertible output is provided at runtime for printing. The **Convert to PDF** option must be checked when you expect to receive output in Microsoft Office (Excel or Word) format.

> [!NOTE]
> In version 10.0.26 and later, to use the **Convert to PDF** option, you must select the **PDF** value for the **Document routing type** parameter of the configured **Printer** destination.

#### ZPL printing

In version 10.0.26 and later, you can also configure the **Printer** destination for the **Common\File** format element selecting the **ZPL** value for the **Document routing type** parameter. When you do this, the **Convert to PDF** option is ignored at runtime and the TXT or XML output is sent directly to a selected printer by using the ZPL contract of the [Document routing agent (DRA)](install-document-routing-agent.md). Use this feature for an ER format that represents a Zebra printing language (ZPL II) label layout to print out various labels.

To learn more about this feature, review the [Design a new ER solution to print ZPL labels](er-design-zpl-labels.md) topic.

### Limitations

The **Printer** destination is implemented only for cloud deployments.

### Use the Printer destination

1. Set the **Enabled** option to **Yes** to send a generated document to a printer.
2. In the **Printer name** field, select the required network printer.
3. Set the **Save in print archive?** option to **Yes** to store the generated output in the print archive, so that it's available for further printing. To access archived output later, go to **Organization administration** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Report archive**.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Convert to PDF** option doesn't have to be turned on when you configure the **Printer** destination. The PDF conversion for printing purposes will occur even if the option is turned off.

To use a specific [page orientation](electronic-reporting-destinations.md#SelectPdfPageOrientation) when you print an outbound document in Excel format, you must turn on the **Convert to PDF** option. When you set the **Convert to PDF** option to **Yes**, the **Page orientation** field becomes available. In the **Page orientation** field, you can select a page orientation.
