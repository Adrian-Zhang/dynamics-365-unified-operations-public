| Feature area    | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Web client  | [Optimize loading of Action center notifications](/dynamics365-release-plan/2022wave1/finance-operations/finance-operations-crossapp-capabilities/optimize-loading-action-center-notifications)  |  |  [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)  |
| Web client  | <p>**(Preview) Standardize keyboard interaction for combo box and lookup controls**</p><p>This preview feature currently includes a targeted adjustment to keyboard interaction for combo box and lookup controls to more closely align them with other Dynamics 365 products. Specifically, the behavior of the **Enter** key has been modified so that it opens a drop-down list when these controls are editable, making it easier for users to get to the list of available values. Pressing **Enter** when the drop-down list is open will continue to select the current value and close the drop-down list.</p>  |  | [Feature management](../../fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md)   |

### Removed and deprecated platform features

The [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic describes features that have been removed, or that are planned for removal in platform updates of Finance and Operations apps.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature isn't in active development and might be removed in a future update.

A deprecation notice will be added in the [Removed or deprecated platform features](removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md) topic 12 months before the removal of any feature from the product.

For breaking changes that affect only compilation time, but that are binary-compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these changes are functional updates that must be made to the compiler.
