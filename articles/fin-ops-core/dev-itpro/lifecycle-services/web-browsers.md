[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Users can access Dynamics Lifecyle Services (LCS) by using the most recent versions of these popular browsers: 

- Microsoft Edge (recommended: [Chromium-based Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium-0f4a3dd7-55df-60f5-739f-00010dba52cf))
- Google Chrome
- Apple Safari
- Internet Explorer 11 (deprecated, not recommended)

To find the latest release for each web browser, go to the software manufacturer's website.

> [!NOTE]
> For optimal performance and an optimal experience, we recommend that you use the latest version of a modern browser, especially Microsoft Edge. 

### Internet Explorer deprecation

Support for Internet Explorer 11 was deprecated in December 2020, with end of support for the browser occurring in August 2021. For more information, see [Internet Explorer deprecation announcement](../../dev-itpro/get-started/removed-deprecated-features-platform-updates.md#platform-updates-for-version-10015-of-finance-and-operations-apps).

Starting in version 10.0.20, users accessing Finance and Operations apps with Internet Explorer will start seeing notifications about the end of support for that browser. Before August 17, 2021, Internet Explorer users will see an informational message that Internet Explorer support is soon ending. After that date, Internet Explorer users will see a warning that support has officially ended. Organizations are encouraged to keep these notifications on unless Internet Explorer is mandated for your users, in which case you can choose to suppress these notifications by disabling the **Internet Explorer end-of-support notifications** feature and relying on internal processes for migrating your user base to Microsoft Edge or another modern browser. 

Starting in version 10.0.25, the use of Internet Explorer 11 will be blocked in Finance and Operations apps. If your organization wants to block Internet Explorer earlier, and you're using version 10.0.21 or later, contact Microsoft Support. 

To prepare organizations and users for the upcoming block of Internet Explorer, in January 2022, Internet Explorer users will start to receive a non-dismissible error message that states that Internet Explorer support will soon be blocked. This error message is **not** controlled by the **Internet Explorer end-of-support notifications** feature. Customers will have to contact Microsoft Support if this message must be suppressed for their organization.
