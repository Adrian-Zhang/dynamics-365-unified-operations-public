# Execution restrictions for specific data export projects 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Certain data export projects have been restricted from execution on Finance and Operations environments running version 10.0.22 or older.

If you have received the following error message: “This data export project is no longer supported for execution. To run this project, it is first required to update the environment to a supported version.” 

You are required to update the environment to a supported version. Otherwise, it will not be possible to execute these data projects. 

For more information about supported versions, see [Service update availability](../ fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases.md).

More information is planned to be added at a later time.
