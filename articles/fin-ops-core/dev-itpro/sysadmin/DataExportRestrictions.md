# Execution restrictions for specific data export projects 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Certain data export projects have been restricted from execution on Finance and Operations environments running version 10.0.22 or older.

If you have received the following error message, you must update the environment to a supported version.  

*This data export project is no longer supported for execution. To run this project, it is first required to update the environment to a supported version.*

If you do not update the environment to a supported version, it will not be possible to execute certain data projects. 

For more information about supported versions, see [Service update availability](../../fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases.md).

More information is planned to be added to this topic at a later time.
