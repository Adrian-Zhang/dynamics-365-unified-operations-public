# Execution restrictions

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Certain Data export projects have been restricted from execution on environments on version 10.0.22 or older.

If you have received the following error message: “This data export project is no longer supported for execution. To run this project, it is first required to update the environment to a supported version.”, then it will be required to update the environment to a supported version. Otherwise it will not be possible to execute these data projects. 
For more information about supported versions, see [Service update availability](../ fin-ops/get-started/public-preview-releases.md).

More information as to why this restriction had to be applied without further announcements, will be added here at a later time.
