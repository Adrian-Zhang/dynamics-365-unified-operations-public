This article lists features that are new or changed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance version 10.0.30. This version has a build number of 10.0.xxxx and is available on the following schedule:

- **Preview of release:** September 2022
- **General availability of release (self-update):** October 2022
- **General availability of release (auto-update):** November 2022

## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features that are included in this release. We might update this article to include features that made it into the build after this article was initially published.

| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|----|----|----|----|
| Accounts receivable  | Free text invoice posting improvement for totals calculation | Weâ€™ve added performance improvements to the free text invoice posting to allow it to run more efficiently. This enhancement works by saving calculated totals, instead of recalculating the totals multiple times during the posting process. This will shorten the posting process.  | Feature management |
| General ledger  | Enhanced performance for source document accounting framework  | We've added performance improvements to batch postings of source documents in order to run more efficiently. This feature initially will only affect free text invoice batch posting with more source documents to be supported in future releases. When this feature is enabled, batch posting is split into smaller units of work preventing system degradation and lessening the chance of issues due to database disconnections. | Feature management |


## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature area | Feature name | More information |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Credit and collections  | Display the **Known as** field on the **All customers** page | This feature provides a way view all fields on the **General** FastTab without having to select the **Show more fields** button. The **Known as** and **Phonetic name** fields will always be displayed. These fields can now be added to the **All customers list view** page and remain on the list view. |
| Globalization | ([ER](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md)) Embed images in Excel documents | ER configurations can be designed to produce business documents in Excel format based on an Excel template that may contain an embedded image with a custom scaling and aspect ratio. This image is used at runtime as a placeholder of a picture in a generated business document. This improvement lets you [consider](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-fillable-excel.md#cell-component) the actual scaling and aspect ratio of using at runtime images when they are placed to a generated document. | 
| Globalization | (ER) Inspect configured components | You can [validate](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-components-inspections.md) every configured ER format and model mapping component at design time. During this validation, a consistency check runs to help prevent runtime issues that might occur. This improvement lets you detect any application artefacts like tables, classes, methods, etc. that are referred to in the evaluated ER component when this artefact has been marked in application code as obsolete. This information allows you to revise the design of the evaluated ER component and to remove references to obsolete artefacts before those artefacts will be removed from the application code preventing issues at runtime. |
| Globalization | (ER) Formula designer | You can use the ER formula [editor](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting-formula-designer.md) to describe data binding, control process flow, specify data formatting, etc. by using various data sources. This editor can use the [relative path](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/er-formula-language.md#relative-path) to describe the location of any formula of a structured data source. This improvement lets you reveal the editable formula on the data source panel among all available data sources within one click. It allows you to quickly visualize the base element of the editable formula, observe its sibling elements, and use all of this in the formula if needed. |
