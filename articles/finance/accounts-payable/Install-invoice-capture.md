## Install the invoice capture service
We target at an out-of-box usage experience for the solution deployment. User just needs several clicks, then the whole solutions can be deployed and usable. 

>[!Note:]  
> If you have installed the solution in private preview, there were major changes on underlying tables and logics and backwards compatibility can't be guarenteed. 
> You will need to uninstall the old solution before you continue. 

### Setup connection for Dynamics 365 finance and operations

You will need to register an azure App with AAD in your azure portal and register the same in your Dynamics 365 finance and operations. 
Note that you must have an Azure subscription and admin access to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 

### Register an Azure app in the Azure portal

1. Sign into the Azure portal.
2. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directories and subscriptions** filter to switch to the tenant that is the same with financial operation environment. 
3. Select Azure Active Directory. 
4. **Manage** > **App registrations > New registration**.
5. Enter a display name for your application. The app registration's automatically generated Application (client) ID,uniquely identifies your app within the identity 
platform. Note the client ID. 
6. Specify who can use the application. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. 
7. Select **Register** to complete the app registration. 

When registration is complete, the Azure portal will display the app registration’s **Overview** pane. 

### Create a client secret

1. In the **Overview** page of registered app, go to **Manage > Certificates and secrets**.
2. Open the **Client secrets** tab, select **New client secret**.
3. Enter a description and choose **Expires** in the side pane > **Add a client secret**. 
4. The client secret is created.

2. Select **Add a permission**.
3. In the **Request API permissions** pane, select **Dynamics ERP**.
4. Continue to choose the **Delegated permissions**.
5. Select the permissions below: 


This will allow the regitered app to access the Dynamics 365 finance and operations environment with Odata protocol.
6. Select **Add permissions** to finish.

correct permissions for the operations that must be performed.
