# Invoice capture Received files

In Invoice Capture, the **Received files** page is a central place to receive invoice files from different sources. 

## Upload invoice file
Accounts Payable clerks can upload invoice images by clicking  **Upload a file**. The **Upload** page will be displayed in the side panel. 
The **Upload** button is available after selecting the file.

## Include/Obsolete invoice files
Users can first select invoices with errors or warnings and decide whether include or obsolete the invoice by clicking the corresponding button in the ribbon. 
An invoice marked as obsolete won't be found in the **Received files (Obsoleted)** view.

## Navigate to captured invoice
Once the received file is successfully recognized, the captured invoiceâ€™s information will be returned by the AI model and entered in Dataverse. The Accounts Payable 
clerk can verify the invoice details by clicking **View captured invoice**. Users can download the original invoice file if needed.
