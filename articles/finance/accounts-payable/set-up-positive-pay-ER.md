# Set up positive pay files using Electronic reporting

Set up positive pay to generate an electronic list of checks that is provided to the bank. Then, when a check is presented to the bank, the bank compares it with the 
list of checks. If the check matches a check in the list, the bank clears it. If the check doesn't match a check in the list, the bank holds it for review.

1. Go to **Workspaces > Electronic reporting**.
2. On the **Microsoft configuration provider** tile, click **Repositories**.
3. Select **Global** and click **Open**.
4. Connect to the repository if needed by clicking the blue link in the dialog.
5. In the configuration list, find and select **Positive pay model > Positive pay format**.
