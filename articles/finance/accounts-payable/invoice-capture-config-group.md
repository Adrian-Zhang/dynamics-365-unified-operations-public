Users can manage the invoice fields list and manual review settings for legal entities using **Configuration group**. Users can set up invoice
configurations for different legal entities in groups. Different legal entities in the same configuration group share the same invoice fields and manual review settings. 

## Manage configuration groups 

To manage configuration groups using the app, users go to **Setup** and go to **System setup > Define configuration groups component**.

On the **Define configuration groups** page: 

The main tab displays the list of the configuration groups that are defined and a default configuration group. 
The following options are available for configuration groups: 

 - Duplicate a configuration group 
Select this option if new configuration groups need duplicate an existing configuration group. Once a configuration group is duplicated, select **OK**.
A duplicate configuration group is created with all the fields same as the chosen configuration group except **Group name** and **Group description**. 

 - Delete configuration groups 
You can select a configuration group and select **Delete** to delete a configuration group. The **Default** configuration group can't be deleted. 

 - Edit configuration group ID 
To edit the configuration group ID, click **Group ID** field and update the **Group ID**. The **Group ID** shouldn't contain spaces, special characters and shouldn't 
exceed 20 characters. The **Group ID** field can only be updated once.

 - Edit configuration group description 
To edit the configuration group description, click the **Description** field and update.

 - Change manual review setting 
The user can decide if an invoice needs to be manually reviewed. 
To change the manual review setting, click **Need manual review** option and select from the following options:
**Always manual review**: Select this option if invoices in this configuration group always need manual review. 
**For errors and warnings**: Select this option if invoices that contain an error or warning messages need manual review. 
**For errors**: Select this option to manually review the invoices that contains error messages. 

 - Change confidence score setting 
Confidence score is metadata provided by the OCR service to report the accuracy of recognized invoice data. The higher the score is, the more accurate the recognized 
data will potentially be. It doesnâ€™t mean that the recognized invoice data with a low confidence score is wrong, the OCR service is not confident about the accuracy. 
The configuration provides flexibility to let users define when manual review is needed according to confidence score. The user can change the confidence score 
threshold for invoices. To update the confidence score setting, click **Confidence score** field and update.

 - **Warning** alert type: Invoice fields that have confidence scores over the warning threshold are considered as correct. The warning threshold must be greater than 
 the error threshold and less than 100. 

 - **Error** alert type: Invoice fields that have confidence scores under the error threshold are considered as failed. Error messages will be dispalyed to 
 inform the user. The error threshold must be greater than zero and less than the warning threshold. The warning messages will be displayed for invoice fields that 
 have confidence scores between the warning threshold and error threshold.

 - Manage invoice fields 
The user can manage the invoice fields list to be displayed in the **Side-by-side Viewer**. Go to the **Invoice field management** tab and click the gear, 
select the invoice fields to be added in the side bar and click **Save** and the selected fields will be added to the list. 
To remove the added invoice field from the list, click **Remove** on the field.
