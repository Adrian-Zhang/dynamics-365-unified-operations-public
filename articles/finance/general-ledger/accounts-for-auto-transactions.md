# Accounts for automatic transactions

The **Accounts for automatic transactions** page is used to define the default main account to be used for each posting type in the system. While most posting types can be configured in a module- or feature-specific page, some posting types can only be configured on the **Accounts for automatic transactions** page.

For example, you can configure the main account to be used for the Customer balance **Posting type** in **Summary** field on the **Customer posting profile** page and use a different main account for each customer profile. This allows you to have more granular control of the postings. On the other hand, the **Error account** can only be specified on the **Accounts for automatic transactions** page.

In a new legal entity, when you open **General ledger &gt; Setup &gt; Accounts for automatic transactions**, the list will be empty. You can add the most common posting types that should be configured on the page by clicking the **Create default types** button. Then for each row, you can select the main account in the **Main account** field to be used in the grid.

If the **Main account** field is left blank for a posting type and you haven't configured a main account in a module-specific or feature-specific page, an error will be received when you post a transaction that uses the posting type. The message will typically read "The account for \[Posting type\] cannot be found."

## Default posting types

The following table shows examples of the default posting types that are created when you click **Create default types.** The table shows sample main accounts and descriptions. The **Debit/Credit** column indicates whether the transaction typically Debit or Credit, or in some cases can post A either. The **Clearing account** column indicates whether the posting type is a clearing account. This means the amount posted in this account is automatically reversed when a later transaction is posted.

## Additional posting types

The following table shows examples of additional posting types that must be configured if you plan to use the related features. These posting types do not have posting profile configuration available in another module. The Debit/Credit column indicates if the transaction typically Debit or Credit, or in some cases can post either. The Clearing account column indicates whether the posting type is a clearing account. This means the amount posted in this account is automatically reversed when a later transaction is posted.

| Posting type                                          | Main account example | Main account name example   | Account type | Debit/ Credit? | Clearing account | Description                                                                                                                         |
