# Milestone templates

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include [preview banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]

This topic explains how to define templates for the milestone billing functionality in Subscription billing. You can define the allocation percentages or amounts for each line within the milestone template. You can then assign the milestone template to billing schedule items that use the milestone billing functionality. 

## Add Template

To add a milestone template:

1. Go to **Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Milestone templates**.
2. Click **New**. 
3. Enter a unique **Milestone template** identifier and a **Description**. 
4. Select an **Allocation method**. 
5. Optionally, specify the **Total amount** for the template. 
6. To add a line, select **Add**, and select the **Item number**. 
   - If **Allocation method** is **Percentage**, specify the allocation **Percentage**. When you specify percentages, the sum **Total percentage** must be equal to 100. 
   - If **Allocation method** is **Variable Amount**, specify the **Amount** for each line. 
   - If **Allocation method** is **Equal Amount**, you do not need to specify an amount. The lines are automatically updated with the correct percentage and amount based on the  number of items added to the template. 
6. Select **Save**.

## Delete Template

To delete a milestone template: 
1. Select one or more lines that you want to delete, and select **Delete**. 
2. When you are asked to confirm the action, select **Yes**.

## Milestone template fields

The **Milestone templates** page contains the following fields:

| **Description**| A description for the milestone template. |  
| **Allocation method**|Select the allocation method: <br />- **Percentage of completion**:Â A cumulative completion value for each line. <br />- **Percentage**: A percentage amount can be specified for the allocation. The sum of all percentages must equal 100. <br />- **Variable amount**: An amount can be specified for the allocation.

The reverse is also true, changing the **Amount** updates the percentage.  |

## Milestone allocation

Before you can begin using milestone functionality, you will want to:

1. Add one or more milestone templates.
2. Create a billing schedule group, and specify the item type as milestone and select a template. This is optional. 
3. In **Item setup**, **Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Items**, select an **Item relation** and a milestone template for the item setup. This is optional.

After milestone templates, billing schedule groups, and items have been created, you can create a billing schedule that usees the milestone functionality. 

To set up billing schedules that use milestones: 

1. From the **All/Active billing schedules** list, select <span class="gui">New</span>. 
2. On the **All billing schedules** page, create a new billing schedule with a customer account and a start date.  
3. In the **Billing schedule lines**, select **Add line** and add Item number. Set the **Item type** to **Milestone**.  
If a default milestone template is set up for the item, the milestone events are automatically added to the billing schedule lines. End dates are blank for milestone lines.
   - If the milestone template is not setup for an item, select **Milestone allocation**. 
   - On the **Milestone allocation**, select a **Milestone template**, make any adjustments as needed, and select **Close** to return to the billing schedule. 
   - Finish creating the billing schedule. 
4. To create invoices for the billing schedule, the end date for each milestone even must be updated. <br />For a single billing schedule, you can update the end date for the milestone event on the **Billing schedule lines**. To update multiple billing schedules, use the **Update completion date process**. 
5. After the end date is updated, you can create the invoice. For a single billing schedule, use the **Generate invoice** button from the **All billing schedules** page. To create invoices for multiple billing schedules, use the **Generate invoice** or **Generate invoice batch processing** under **Periodic tasks**.
