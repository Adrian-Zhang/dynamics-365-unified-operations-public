Use the **Copy schedule** page to create a new billing schedule from an existing billing schedule. This will create a new billing schedule that has the same settings as an existing billing schedule. 

## Copy Schedule

To copy a billing schedule, follow these steps: 
1. Select an existing billing schedule from the **All billing schedules** or **Active billing schedules** list.
2. On the **Billing schedule** tab, select **Copy schedule**. 
3. Select the **Customer account**. 
4. Change the billing start and end dates as needed. 
5. If needed, change values for the optional boxes: **End user account**, **Partner account**, **Customer reference**, **Customer requisition**, or **Deferral start date**. 
6. Select **View preview** to view and select the billing schedule lines that you want to copy. 
7. Select **Copy**.

After the copy process is finished, the new billing schedule appears at the bottom of the **All/Active billing schedules** list or on the **Billing schedules** page. 

## Copy Items to Another Billing Schedule

1. Select an existing billing schedule from the **All billing schedules** or **Active billing schedules** list.
2. On the **Billing schedule** tab, select **Copy schedule**. 
3. Select the **Customer account** and then select a **Billing schedule number**. 
4. Update the billing start and end dates. 
5. If needed, update: **End user account**, **Partner account**, **Customer reference**, **Customer requisition** or **Deferral start date**. 
6. Select **View preview** to view and select the billing schedule lines that you want to copy to an existing billing schedule. 
7. Select **Copy**.

After the copy process is finished, review the billing schedule to which you copied the items, and that the items were added as expected.
