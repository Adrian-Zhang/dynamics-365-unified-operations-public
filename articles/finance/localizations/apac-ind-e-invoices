# Electronic invoices in India

An electronic invoice is a legally accepted digital tax receipt document that your organization gets registered at Invoice Registration Portal (IRP). 
The obligation and applicability of using the electronic invoices depends on the annual turnover (minimum applicable threshold is determined by the legislation). Depending on this turnover, some companies might not be able to access IRP portal directly and require using of additional possibilities like integration with GST Service Providers (GSP). As a part of electronic invoice registration, it is also supported to register e-Way Bill at the IRP portal.
By using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance to generate electronic invoices, you help make sure that the electronic invoices that your organization generates are secure, confidential, authentic, and legally acceptable. You can also make sure that required standards are applied to your electronic invoices.
As an alternative integration option (i.e., when the GSP integration is expected to be used), it is supported to exchange the applicable invoices details through the file exporting and importing option.

## Setting up electronic invoices
### Feature activation
You can open the **Feature management workspace** by selecting the appropriate tile on the dashboard or by going to *System administration > Workspaces > Feature management*. Among other features find **(India) Electronic invoice under GST** and use button Enable to activate the feature. Read more about feature management and available options in [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) article.

### Import Electronic reporting (ER) configurations
To prepare Finance to interoperate with the IRP system, you must import the latest versions of the ER configurations listed below. Refer to (ER) Import configurations from RCS article for details.
Note: While importing from Global Repo or LCS, you need to import only format configurations. Related model and model mapping configurations will be automatically imported. It is recommended to ensure that the latest configuration versions available are imported.
•	Invoice model
•	Invoice model mapping (IN)
•	GST Invoice format (IN)
•	Electronic Messages framework model
•	eInvoice model mapping
•	eInvoice format (IN)
•	eInvoice authentication import format (IN)
•	eInvoice data import format (IN)
After all the ER configurations from the preceding list are imported, set the Default for model mapping option to Yes for the eInvoice model mapping configuration.

### Set up Electronic messaging (EM) functionality
Electronic message functionality is provided to maintain the different processes that are used in electronic reporting and transmission of different document types. For more information about electronic messages, see Electronic messaging article.
The most important step in setting up Electronic messaging functionality for IRP integration is to import the provided Indian IRP integration setup V5.zip data package. Once successfully imported setup data, almost all required setup will be auto created. There only remaining required setup will be selecting parameters for executable classes and setting up number sequences for Electronic messaging. All those tasks are described below.
Note: It is always recommended to apply only the latest version of the data package available at LCS, which could be V5 or higher.

#### Import a package of data entities that includes a predefined EM setup
The process of setting up the electronic message functionality to interoperate with the IRP system has multiple steps. Because the names of some predefined entities are used in the ER configurations, it is important that you use a set of predefined values that are delivered in a package of data entities for the related tables, and that you import the ER configurations before you import the data entities.
1.       In Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Service (LCS), go to the Shared asset library, and select the Data package asset type.
2.       In the list of data package files, find and download Indian IRP integration setup V5.zip.
3.       After the file is downloaded, open Finance, and select the company that you will interoperate with the IRP system from.
4.       Go to Workspaces > Data management.
5.       In the Data management workspace, go to Framework parameters > Entity settings, and select Refresh entity list. Wait for confirmation that the refresh has been completed. For more information about how to refresh the entity list, see Entity list refresh.
6.       Validate that the source data and target data are correctly mapped. For more information, see Validate that the source data and target data are mapped correctly.
7.       Before the data entities are used for the first time to import the data from the package, sync the mapping of the source data and target data. In the list for the package, select a data entity, and then, on the Action Pane, select Modify target mapping.
8.       Above the grid for the package, select Generate mapping to create a mapping from scratch, and then save the mapping.
9.       Repeat steps 7 and 8 for every data entity in the package before you start the import.
For more information about data management, see Data management overview.
You must now import data from the Indian IRP integration setup V5.zip file into the selected company. In the Data management workspace, select Import, specify a Group name, select Add file, and then, in the drop-down dialog box, set the Source data format field to Package.
10.   Select Upload and add, select the Indian IRP integration setup V5.zip file on your computer, and upload it.
11.   After the data entities are uploaded, on the Action Pane, select Import.
You will receive a notification in Action center, or you can manually refresh the page to view the progress of the data import. When the import is completed, the Execution summary page shows the results.
After data entities are imported, you will find the following types of electronic message processing. This processing contains almost all the setup that is required in your legal entity.
•	OnlineInvoicing – Indian online invoicing. This processing supports interoperation with the IRP system to submit information about sales, free text, project customer invoices and transfer orders. It parses the response from IRP to obtain and save Invoice Registration Number (IRN) and signed QR code.
•	CancelInvoice – Indian online invoicing. This processing supports interoperation with the IRP system to cancel previously registered customer invoices.
•	RegisterEWB – Register E-way Bill. This process supports interoperation with the system to submit information with E-Way bill details. As a result, the E-Way bill Status along with other details such as E-way bill No, E-way bill date are updated.
•	CancelEWB – Cancel E-way Bill. This processing supports interoperation with the system to cancel previously registered E-Way bills.
To review the imported processing, go to Tax > Setup > Electronic messages > Electronic message processing.

#### Set up the integration internet addresses
Go to Tax > Setup > Parameters > Electronic messages > Web service settings.
Enter the following information to define the internet address for web services. Testing addresses applicable for the Sandbox environment are presented below.
•	Authentication - https://einv-apisandbox.nic.in/eivital/v1.04/auth
•	Generate IRN - https://einv-apisandbox.nic.in/eicore/v1.04/Invoice
•	Cancel IRN - https://einv-apisandbox.nic.in/eicore/v1.04/Invoice/Cancel
•	Generate WEB - https://einv-apisandbox.nic.in/eiewb/v1.04/ewaybill
•	Cancel EWB - https://einv-apisandbox.nic.in/ewaybillapi/v1.04/ewayapi
Note: Internet addresses are subject to change by the National Informatics Centre (NIC). Therefore, we recommend that you check for actual internet addresses on the official website of the e-Invoice System or other appropriate sources. The official documentation also has information about the available production internet addresses that you should set up.
On the Request parameters, specify the same set of values for all the above web services:
Parameter	Value
Successful response code	200
Request method	POST
Content type	Application/json
Request headers format mapping	eInvoice format (IN)
IRP portal might have limitation to the number of IP addresses from which it could be accessed. To satisfy these requirements, it is possible to activate the Use proxy server checkbox and set up proxy server parameters, such as Proxy server IP address, Proxy server port number and Proxy authentication (stored in Key Vault).
#### Set up additional fields  
EM items have additional fields that are included in the Indian Online Invoicing type of electronic message processing (OnlineInvoicing) that is used to interoperate with the IRP system and imported into the system by using a package of data entities. Additional fields are associated with EM items and are required for their processing. The system automatically sets values for additional fields when actions are run. IRP integration uses only one additional field. Open Tax > Setup > Electronic messages > Additional fields to open Additional fields page and create new one, if not imported from the data package: Field name: AppKey, Description: Unique ID, identifying unique user session.
Set up executable class parameters
To finalize the Electronic messages setup after importing data package, you need to complete the below procedure:
1.	Open Tax > Setup > Electronic messages > Executable class setting.
2.	Select Executable class “Generate EM”.
3.	In the Action Pane, select Parameters and then, in the dialog box that appears, set the following values for the parameters of the executable class.
a.	Format mapping to GST Invoice format (IN)
b.	Message status in case of success to Generated
c.	Message item status in case of technical error to Created

### Set up number sequences for electronic messages
To work with the Electronic messages functionality, you must define related number sequences.
1.	Go to Tax > Setup > Parameters > General ledger parameters.
2.	On the Number sequences tab, set up two number sequences:
•	Message
•	Message item
### Set up batch settings for automated processing of interoperation with the IRP system
1.	Go to Tax > Setup > Electronic messages > Electronic message processing.
2.	Select processing like OnlineInvoicing or CancelInvoice.
3.	On the Batch FastTab, select Create batch, and then define the required parameters.
### Set up security roles for electronic message processing
Different groups of users might require access to OnlineInvoicing and CancelInvoice processing. You can limit access to the processing based on security groups that are defined in the system.
To limit access to OnlineInvoicing and CancelInvoice processing, follow these steps.
1.	Go to Tax > Setup > Electronic messages > Electronic message processing.
2.	Select OnlineInvoicing or CancelInvoice processing, and then add the security groups that must work with that processing. If no security group is defined for the processing, only a system admin can see the processing on the Electronic messages page.

### Set up certificates and secrets for the IRP system
To interoperate with the IRP system, you must use a security certificate that is provided by the operator as well as all the other secrets obtained from IRP during GSTIN registration process. There are two options for storing this sensitive data:
	Azure Key Vault storage
	Local storage (not recommended option for production environment
It is highly recommended that you use Azure Key Vault storage. For more information about how to set up Key Vault, see Setting up Azure Key Vault Client and Maintaining Azure Key Vault storage articles.
Note: If you decide to follow recommended setup and use Key Vault, all the secrets used - User name, User password, Client Id, Client secret and Certificate – must be uploaded to and defined in customer’s Key Vault storage prior defining Key Vault parameters.

Complete following procedure to enable usage of Key Vault and advanced certificate storage:
1.	Go to System administration > Setup > System parameters.
2.	Set the Use advanced certificate store option to No to store sensitive data locally. Set the option to Yes to use Key Vault storage.
3.	If you set the Use advanced certificate store option to Yes, go to System administration > Setup > Key Vault parameters to create up the Key Vault parameters.
4.	Create a secret with reference to the custom Key Vault storage for each of five required secrets: User name, User password, Client Id, Client secret, Certificate.
Note: The .CER certificate must be stored in Azure Key Vault as a secret, not a certificate. You need to open your .CER file in any text editor and copy its entire content to a secret value in Key Vault.

### Set up electronic invoice parameters
Use Accounts receivable > Setup > Electronic invoice parameters page to provide information used to submit invoices to IRP and additional parameters to control validations at invoice posting time. The following table describes available options.
•	Validate before posting	- You can enable additional validation against all mandatory information to be included in the electronic invoice at the invoice posting time.
•	Validation format - ER format used for validation against all required mandatory elements in the electronic invoice. Available only when Validate before posting function is enabled.
•	GSTIN - Your Goods and Services Taxpayer Identification Number, used for IRP integration.
•	User name - Reference to Key Vault secret for your user name provided by NIC, used for IRP integration
•	User password - Reference to Key Vault secret for your user password provided by NIC, used for IRP integration
•	Client Id - Reference to Key Vault secret for your user Client Id provided by NIC, used for IRP integration
•	Client secret - Reference to Key Vault secret for your Client secret provided by NIC, used for IRP integration
•	Certificate - Reference to Key Vault secret for your Certificate provided by NIC, used for IRP integration

### Set up unit of measure
You need to repeat that for all units of measure that you use in electronic invoices to match allowed external codes.
1.	Go to Organization administration > Setup > Units > Units.
2.	Select one of units, e.g. "ea" unit and click External codes.
3.	Enter Code (e.g. “EInv_IN”) and External code definition

Note: Code will be used across all units of measure to identify master data set of units of measure codes accepted by electronic invoicing.
4.	Select your created electronic invoicing unit external code (e.g., "Einv_IN") and enter the Value (e.g., "NOS") in the bottom grid of the form
The external codes will be used as international trade units of measure codes recommended by technical specification.

### Set up HSN codes and products
Details on how to set up HSN codes can be found in Define HSN codes and Service Accounting Codes article. The below procedures illustrate only the process of setting up the code and assigning it to the product.
Define HSN code
1.	Go to Tax > Setup > Sales tax > India > HSN code.
2.	Create a record.
3.	In the Chapter field, enter a value.
4.	In the Heading field, enter a value.
5.	In the Subheading field, enter a value.
6.	In the Country/region extension field, enter a value.
7.	In the Statistical suffix field, enter a value.
8.	Save the record and verify that the HSN code field is updated.
9.	In the Description field, enter a value.
10.	Select Close.
Assign HSN codes to products
1.	Go to Product information management > Products > Released products.
2.	Select a product, and then select Edit.
3.	On the General FastTab, if the product type is Item, select a value in the HSN code field.

### Set up tax registration numbers
Details on how to set up GSTIN master data can be found in Create a GSTIN master article. The below procedure illustrates only the simplified process of setting up registration numbers for use in electronic invoicing.
1.	Go to Tax > Setup > Sales Tax > Enterprise tax registration
2.	If you do not have any GSTIN type registration numbers, create a new record. Otherwise go to step number 5
3.	Select Tax type = GST and Registration number type = Company
4.	Enter the Registration number and save the data
5.	Expand the eInvoice parameters fast tab
6.	Enter the parameters used as credentials: User name, User password, Client ID, Client Secret and Certificate. This setup is required when there are different GSTIN registrations are expected to be used for sending e-invoices. When only single reqistration is expected to be used in the company, this could be specified only on the Electronic invoices parameters (India) form
Note: The fast tab eInvoice parameters in Enterprise tax registration numbers form is available only when all the following conditions are met: Tax type = GST, Type = GSTIN, Registration number type = Company and the user has full access rights to the menu item which opens the form Electronic invoices parameters (India).
When you send an invoice for registration at IRP, the system is first trying to obtain parameters from Enterprise tax registration numbers for the seller GSTIN of the electronic invoice. In case these settings are not found, the system will use parameters from Electronic invoices parameters (India). These global parameters will be used only when GSTIN in these settings is the same as the seller GSTIN of the electronic invoice that is being sent. If global settings have different GSTIN, it means that there were no credentials found that can be used for communication with IRP, and the error will be shown
7.	Create a new record
8.	Select Tax type = GST and Registration number type = Customer
9.	Enter the Registration number and save the data

On the E-way bill types form, create a new record or select an existing record and select the Can be sent electronically parameter to Yes to confirm that the type used is marked as the one applicable for e-invoice and e-Way bill integration.

## Working with electronic invoices
EM functionality runs actions that are included in the processing groups, based on the status of messages and message items. This could be processed either by the periodic batch job or activated manually.

### Register electronic invoices
When an invoice is posted for e-invoice enabled customer from a sales order, Free text invoice or Project invoice proposal, you can run EM processing to create JSON electronic invoice and register it at the IRP.
1.	Open Tax > Inquiries and Report > Electronic messages > Electronic messages page.
2.	Select OnlineInvoicing processing
3.	Use Run processing function to create electronic invoices for all relevant posted documents and send them to IRP
Note: You can use Run in the background option to set up a batch processing to send all appropriate newly posted documents to IRP based on predefined time interval. 
Once operation is completed you can see information about the number of processed documents in the action log.
Successful completion of invoice registration will update information in E-invoice status page which can be found in Sales or Project invoice journals, as well as invoice flag Sent electronically.
Received IRN and QR code can be printed in Tax invoice reports available in the Sales or Project invoice journals.
In addition to the auto-creating e-invoice status ‘Created’, there is a function Create e-invoice status (Accounts receivable > Periodic task > Create e-invoice status), which would allow re-initiation of e-invoice processing including the possibility to send even the invoices poster earlier. E-invoices which are already sent, could not be affected with this option.

### Cancel electronic invoices
When an invoice is registered at IRP, you can select it for cancellation and run EM processing to cancel it at the IRP system.
1.	Open Sales or Project invoice journal page and identify invoice you want to cancel
2.	Use E-Invoice option to open e-invoice status page
 
3.	Use Cancel function to select a previously successfully registered invoice for cancellation
Note: Status will be updated to “Cancel”
4.	Open Tax > Inquiries and Report > Electronic messages > Electronic messages page.
5.	Select CancelInvoice processing
6.	Use Run processing function to cancel all electronic invoices selected for cancellation
Note: You can use Run in the background option to set up a batch processing to send all appropriate newly posted documents to IRP based on predefined time interval. Once operation is completed you can see information about the number of processed documents in the action log pane.

During the Transfer order cancellation, there is another option to handle when a feature “Transfer Order Cancelation” is available and enabled in the Feature management. Once it is enabled, there is a possibility of cancelling a shipment.
1.	Go to Inventory management > Inquiries and reports > Transfer orders > Transfer order history and select the shipment for cancelation
2.	Use Cancel button and confirm shipment cancellation

### Inquiry on electronic invoices
You can quickly review which invoices are registered by opening Sales or Project invoice journal and checking the status indicated in Sent electronically column.

You can find detailed information about status of electronic invoice using E-Invoice page available in Sales and Project invoice journal pages.

The E-Invoice page, Overview tabshows statuses of electronic invoice. Here are the possible statuses the electronic invoice can get:
•	Created: Invoice is posted and ready to be sent to IRP. You can run OnlineInvoicing processing to start registration process.
•	Sent: Invoice has been successfully registered at IRP
•	Cancel: Invoice is selected for cancellation. You can run CancelInvoice processing to start cancellation process.
•	Cancelled: Invoice has been successfully cancelled at IRP
After successful registration in the same tab, you will see Acknowledgement number and Acknowledgement date. Go to Details tab to review received IRN, Signed QR code and Signed invoice. 
 

## E-Way Bill information
### Register e-Way Bill
When the invoice is posted for the customer account enabled for electronic invoices, it is possible to add the E-Way bill details from the invoice journal form which would be sent to the service as well as electronic invoice. Open the E-Way bill from the Invoice journal form using the E-Way bill button on the top ribbon, menu Invoice.
On the E-Way bill form, the following details should be provided:
• Tax type
• Direction
• E-Way bill type
• Mode of transport
• Vehicle No
• Document No
• Document date
• Distance
• Transporter Id
• Transporter name
• Vehicle type
After the E-Way bill for the invoice is entered, the E-Way bill status will be displayed as Created on the E-Invoice form.
Open Tax > Inquiries and Report > Electronic messages > Electronic messages page. Select the RegisterEWB and select Run processing function. A a result, the E-Way bill is processed and sent to the service, the E-Way bill status is updated to Sent and the following fields are updated: E-way bill No, E-way bill date.

### Cancel e-Way Bill
For Sent E-Waybills it is possible to run the Cancel E-Way bill function and then Cancel the electronic invoice, updating its status to Canceled.
To review the imported processing, go to Tax > Setup > Electronic messages > Electronic message processing.

## Alternative integration options (GSP file integration)
This feature Enables possibility to exchange the list of electronic invoices in India via file integration.

### Prerequisites
The primary address of the legal entity must be in India.
The following or higher versions of GER configurations should be imported:
GST Export Invoices format (IN).version.104.5
GST Import Invoices format (IN).version.104.7

In the Accounts Receivable > Setup > Electronic invoice parameters, on the File integration tab, select the Export format and Import format configurations.

### File integration for the e-invoice information
To review all electronic invoices which could be exported using the file integration, the E-Invoice form (Accounts Receivable>Invoices>E-Invoice) could be used.

To export electronic invoices to file, run the File Integration/Export to file function. By default, the file would be generated and saved to user Download folder, however extra setup could be done using Electronic reporting destinations (for more details, please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-destinations)

It is also possible to import the file in return, updating the E-Invoice details and status based on the input file. To run the procedure, File Integration/Import from file function is available. By default, the user can select a file manually on the importing dialog. For additional options for setting up the Electronic reporting Source, see here: Configure data import from SharePoint - Finance & Operations | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs

## FAQ
Q: Can I unselect an invoice previously successfully registered and selected for cancellation?
It is not possible to unselect an invoice once selected for cancellation in the E-Invoice status page. IRP does not allow to send again an invoice once cancelled so the only option is to create and post a new one.

Q: Can I specify additional criteria to be considered when selecting invoices for electronic processing, either to register or cancel invoice?
You can review and modify queries used for invoice selection in Tax > Setup > Electronic messages > Populate record actions page. Edit query button opens system query form to set up additional or modify existing query criteria.

Q: Where can I find detailed information about what went wrong for an invoice which was not successfully registered?
You can review action log in Open Tax > Inquiries and Report > Electronic messages > Electronic messages page to see the details. Response code and response description are available in the action that failed.

Q: What are the supported formats of electronic invoice for India?
The export of electronic invoice can be done in JSON format that contains all required fields defined in technical specification. If there is another format or you need to add extra information to the electronic invoice message, you may use Electronic Reporting to modify Microsoft provided format or create a new one. Find more information in Electronic reporting (ER) overview article. After the custom format is configured, it should be selected in the Executable class parameters instead of GST Invoice format (IN).
Q: What are the supported integrations for Indian electronic invoice registration?
The generated JSON electronic can be submitted to IRP directly and that is a default setup of Electronic messages done though importing data package. As the out of the box supported integration is using Electronic messages, you can use it to change configurations and validate the possibility to integrate with any GSP of your choice. For more information about electronic messages, see Electronic messaging article.

Q: There are several integration possibilities supported by the IRP, which should I use to get credentials? Can I use the credentials in the production environment?
The supported integration option is available for the companies who are able to access ERP through direct API access. At the moment of publication, this access could be granted  only to companies with annual turnover exceeding the defined  threshold, or ones who had registered at the E-Way Bill portal, other companies have to connect through GSP. You can also check the information at the e-Invoice API developer’s portal for more information on the process of On-Boarding and receiving the credentials applicable to Sandbox and Prod environments.

Q: Issue 1: Unable to post project invoice. When the “Validate before posting” checkbox is turned on and user is trying to post project invoice proposal, the system is throwing a validation error "Document Details: Document number cannot be empty."
Solution: Go to Tax - Setup - Tax configuration - Tax setup. Select the company and click Parameters. Set Tax document posting mode to "Synchronous".
Action: Generate SalesInvoice/ProjInvoice/CustomsShippingBillJour/TransferOrder EM

Q: Issue 2. Cannot find 'StateCode_IN' field in 'LogisticsAddressState' table during the e-invoice generation in EM
Solution. Disable the feature “Minimize memory consumption by storing datasets at ER reports runtime” in feature management. 
 
Q: Issue 3. Error generating token request
Solution. Make sure the GER configurations, e-Invoice parameters or KeyVault setup does not have missing setup. If the error contains "Function DigitalCertificateManager::findCertificateBySubject has been incorrectly called" then the Certificate is set up incorrectly. Download a certificate from IRP again and add it to the Azure KeyVault as a secret by copying entire file content.
Example of a proper setup:
 
Q: Issue 3. Error token response importing. Invalid Client-ID/Client-Secret, or Invalid Username or password.
Solution. Check Azure KeyVault. ClientId or Secret is incorrect.

Q: Issue 4. 2150: Duplicate IRN
Solution: This shouldn't happen in production. The issue appears when user is using the same credentials on different environments and the same invoice numbers are sent to the IRP. Go to Tax - Setup - GST reference number sequence group and set up a unique number sequence for the AR GST invoice.
	
Q: Issue 5. Other types of errors. Example: "The field HSN Code must be a string with a minimum length of 6 and a maximum length of 8." or "Recipient PIN code should be 999999 for Direct Export"
Solution. Read the error code and correct the master data. If something is wrong in the customer data or company data, it can be corrected. Correct it, then select an EM with an error, delete the corresponding EM item and run the processing again. It will create a new EM with a fixed JSON. If something is wrong in the transaction data (invoice lines or tax transactions), it can't be fixed easily. User should revert invoice, fix the master data and try to create a new invoice.
