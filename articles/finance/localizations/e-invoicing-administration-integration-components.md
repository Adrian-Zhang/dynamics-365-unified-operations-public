# Electronic invoicing administration and integration components

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the components that are related to the administration of Electronic invoicing and their roles in the Electronic invoicing setup and operation.

## Microsoft Azure

Use Microsoft Azure to set up a storage account and create secrets for the Azure Key Vault. These resources must be set up with your Azure subscription and are fully owned and managed by you.

A storage account is a mandatory component of the Electronic invoicing service and is used to store all electronic files that are processed or generated by Electronic invoicing. These files include:

  - Business data from Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain management, or other connected applications in the Unified structure (JSON format).
  - Files generated during fils generation and transformation.
  - Incoming external data, like responses from external Web services.
  - Inbound electronic invoices.
 
The Azure Key Vault is another mandatory component that you need to work with Electronic invoicing. The Azure Key Vault is used to store:

  - THe Storage Access Signature (SAS) token of your storage account. Microsoft supports a high level of security and data privacy. Because of this, you need to store your SAS token in Azure Key Vault as a secret, but not use the SAS token directly.
  - Secrets, accounts, passwords that you will use in different scenarios.
  - Certificates with secrets for digital signing and establishing trusted connection with external Web services.


## Lifecycle Services
Use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to enable the Electronic invoicing A\add-in for your LCS deployment project.

> [!NOTE]
> The installation of the add-ins in LCS requires at least a Tier 2 environment. For more information about environment planning, see [Environment planning](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/environment-planning.md).

## Regulatory Configuration Services
Dynamics 365 Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) is the interface that's used to configure Electronic invoicing. Resources such as environments and Electronic invoicing features are created, maintained, and hosted in RCS. When the resources are ready, they are published to the Electronic invoicing service and stored in the Global repository.

## Finance and Supply Chain management
Currently, Microsoft supports out-of-the-box integration with the Finance and Supply Chain management applications as a main billing system that operates with the Electronic invoicing service to generate and submit electronic invoices (outbound electronic documents), and receive electronic invoices from vendors (inbound electronic documents).
Finance and Supply Chain management generates business data in a unified structure and then submits this data with additional metadata (Context) to Electronic invoicing. Finance or Supply Chain management then requests the status of the documents being processed by Electronic invoicing. The detailed results are received as a log which links to the generated electronic files, or other data that is related to the submitted documents. Depending on the scenarios, the system updates Finance and Supply Chain management data, such as invoice status, or provided external unique identifiers of invoices registered in the Tax authority (UUID).
