# Electronic invoicing administration and integration components

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the components that are related to administration of Electronic invoicing and their roles in the Electronic invoicing setup and operation.!

## Microsoft Azure
Use Microsoft Azure to set up a storage account and create the secrets for Azure Key Vault. These resources must be setup with your Azure subscription and are fully owned and managed by you.
Storage account is a mandatory component of the Electronic invoicing service and is used for storing all electronic files that are processed or generated by Electronic invoicing, that include:
  - Business data from Finance and Supply Chain management, or other connected applications in Unified structure (JSON format)
  - Files generated during files generation and transformation
  - Incoming external data, like responses from external Web services
  - Inbound electronic invoices
 
Azure Key Vault is another mandatory component to work with Electronic invoicing. It is used for storing:
  - Storage Access Signature (SAS) token of your storage account. Microsoft support high level of security and data privacy, that is why you need to store your SAS token in Azure Key Vault as a secret, but not use SAS token directly
  - Secrets, accounts, passwords that you will use in different scenarios
  - Certificates with secrets for digital signing and establishing trusted connection with external Web services


## Lifecycle Services
Use Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) to enable the Electronic invoicing Add-in for your LCS deployment project.

> [!NOTE]
> The installation of the add-ins in LCS requires at least a Tier 2 environment. For more information about environment planning, see [Environment planning](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/imp-lifecycle/environment-planning.md).


## Regulatory Configuration Services
Dynamics 365 Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) is the interface that is used to configure Electronic invoicing. Resources such as environments and Electronic invoicing features are created, maintained, and hosted in RCS. When the resources are ready, they are published to Electronic invoicing service and are stored in Global repository.


## Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain management
Currently Microsoft supports out of the box integration with Finance and Supply Chain management application as main billing system that can operate with Electronic invoicing service for generation and submission externally electronic invoices (Outbound electronic documents), and receive electronic invoices from vendors (Inbound electronic documents).
Finance and Supply Chain management generates business data in unified structure and submits this data with additional metadata (Context) to Electronic invoicing. Then Finance and Supply Chain management requests the status of documents processing by Electronic invoicing, and receives detailed results as a log, and links to the generated electronic files, or other data that is related to the submitted documents. Depending on the scenarios, system updates Finance and Supply Chain management data, like status of invoices, or providing external unique identifiers of invoices registered in the Tax authority (UUID).
