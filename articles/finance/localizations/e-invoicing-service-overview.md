# Electronic invoicing overview

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Electronic invoicing for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management is a hyper-scalable multitenant service that enables configurable processing of electronic invoices and configurable electronic document exchange. The processing and integration rules are fully configurable, and the logic is run outside Finance and Supply Chain Management. The service is targeted mainly at e-invoice processing in business-to-government scenarios, but it can be custom-configured for other purposes including business-to-business scenarios of different types of the documents.

Electronic invoicing can help you achieve the following goals:
  - Fast and easy adoption of country/region-specific requirements
  - Standardized implementations of an Electronic invoicing solution
  - Enhanced traceability of document history
  - Shorter implementation cycle
  - Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO)
  - Easily adjustable configurations that don't required code changes
  - Simplified configuration packaging
  - Built-in export, import, and integration, and easy extensibility in the processing of e-invoice documents
  - Easy reuse of the same export, import, and integration configurations across companies
