Follow these steps to share a Globalization feature with an external organization.
1. Sign in to your RCS account.
2. In the **Globalization feature** workspace, in the **Features** section, select the **Electronic invoicing** tile.
3. On the **Electronic invoicing features** page, select the feature and the feature version to share. You can't share feature version in Draft status.
4. On the **Organizations** tab, select **Share with**, and then, in the drop-down dialog box, enter the organization's domain name.
5. Select **Share**.

The feature is shared with the selected organization and is available for that organization in the Global repository. From there, the feature can be imported into the organization's instance of RCS so that it can be used.
