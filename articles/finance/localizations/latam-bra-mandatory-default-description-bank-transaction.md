Use the **(Brazil) Mandatory bank transaction description** feature to enable mandatory input of descriptions in the bank account reconciliation transaction to avoid posting a bank transaction journal that contains transaction lines with no description.

1. In Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, navigate to the **Feature management** workspace.
2. In the list of features, search for **(Brazil) Mandatory bank transaction description**. If this feature doesn't appear on the page, select **Check for updates**.
3. Select the feature, and then select **Enable now**.

   You can turn off the feature after it has been enabled.
