# Report about operations with traceble goods

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The traceability system has been operational since July 8. 
Its action begins from the moment of importation of imported goods into the territory of the Russian Federation, and ends with the disposal of such goods: sale to an individual, recycling, transfer to production, export.
