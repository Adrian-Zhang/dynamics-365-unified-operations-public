# Set up Azure resources for Electronic invoicing

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

There are three steps that make up the process to set up Azure resources for Electronic invoicing. The first two steps, **Create an Azure Key Vault in Azure portal**, and **Create an Azure storage account in Azure portal**, are mandatory. Step three, **Configure a SharePoint connection**, is optional.

## Create an Azure Key Vault in Azure portal
Create a Key Vault with your Azure subscription. We recommend that you create a separate Key Vault for Electronic invoicing and that you don't mix secrets with other applications. Create as many secrets and certificates as you need for your scenarios in electronic documents. At least one secret must be created to store the SAS token of your Azure storage account.
To complete the step, see [Create an Azure Key Vault in Azure portal](e-invoicing-create-azure-key-vault-azure-portal.md).

## Create an Azure storage account in Azure portal
You own all of the electronic documents and files that are generated by the Electronic invoicing service or those that enter the service. The documents and files are stored in the Azure storage account that you are creating with your Azure subscription. The service will access your storage account using the SAS token taken from your Key Vault secret.
To create an Azure storage account, see  [Create Azure Storage account in Azure portal](e-invoicing-create-azure-storage-account-azure-portal.md).

## Configure a SharePoint connection
In some scenarios, you might need to save electronic files to and retrieve them from SharePoint. To make sure that the Electronic invoicing service can access your SharePoint folders, configure an access to SharePoint. For information about how to configure a SharePoint connection, see [Configure SharePoint connection](e-invoicing-create-sharepoint-connection.md).
