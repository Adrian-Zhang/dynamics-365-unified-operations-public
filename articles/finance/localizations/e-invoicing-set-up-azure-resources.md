## Step 1 (Mandatory). Create Azure Key Vault in Azure portal
Create a Key Vault with your Azure subscription. Microsoft recommends to create a separate Key Vault for Electronic invoicing to not mix secrets with other applications. Create as many secrets and certificates as you need for your scenarios in electronic documents, but at least one secret must be created to store SAS token of your Azure storage account from Step 2 below.
To complete the step follow instructions: [Create Azure Key Vault in Azure portal](e-inv_tut-setup-electronic-invoicing_azure_create-keyvault.md).

## Step 2 (Mandatory). Create Azure Storage account in Azure portal
You will own all electronic documents and files that are generated by Electronic invoicing service, or enter the service. They will be stored in Azure storage account with your Azure subscription, that you should create at this step. The service will access it using SAS token taken from your Key Vault secret.
To complete the step follow instructions:  [Create Azure Storage account in Azure portal](e-inv_tut-setup-electronic-invoicing_azure_create-storage.md).

## Step 3 (Optional). Configure Sharepoint connection
In some of the scenarios you might need to save electronic files to and get them from Sharepoint. To make sure that Electronic invoicing service can access to Sharepoint folders, you must configure an access to Sharepoint. This step describes how to do that.
To complete the step follow instructions:  [Configure SharePoint connection](e-inv_tut-setup-electronic-invoicing_azure_configure-sharepoint.md).
