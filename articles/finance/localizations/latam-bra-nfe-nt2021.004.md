During posting of outbound electronic fiscal documents, when tag tpNF = 1 (outgoing):

-   When the Tax registration ID (base CNPJ) of the Transporter is equal to the Tax registration ID (base CNPJ) of the Issuer, the Freight charges terms must be different from Prepaid (modFrete = 0), otherwise it violates validation rule X04-50.

During posting of inbound electronic fiscal documents, when tag tpNF = 0 (inbound):

-   When the Tax registration ID (base CNPJ) of the Transporter is equal to the Tax registration ID (base CNPJ) of the Issuer, the Freight charges terms must be different from Collect (modFrete = 1), otherwise it violates validation rule X04-100.
