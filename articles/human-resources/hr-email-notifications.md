# Email notification feature


[!INCLUDE [PEAP](../includes/peap-2.md)]

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

The email notification feature provides the ability to send email notifications and reminders to the employees in the new hire enrollment, open enrollment, and qualifying life 
event scenarios. It allows the users (mostly admins) to create and set multiple email templates, as needed for specific scenarios, and send the notifications using the 
**Benefits management** workspace and the **Worker benefits** page. You can also track the notifications/reminders history. 

## Set up Human resources shared parameters

You can find **Benefit email templates** on the **Human resources shared parameters** page. Here you can create and set the **Benefits email templates** for the different 
types of communication to send to employees or employee groups. 

## Create a new email ID template

To create a new email ID template:
1. Go to **System email templates**.
2. Click **New** and enter a name in the **Email ID** field.
3. Enter the other fields as needed.
4. Click **Email message** to upload the template. 
5. On the **Human resources shared parameters** page, select the newly created template from **System templates** and move it under **Templates for benfits**. 

## Send email to employees

To send an email to a new hire who hasn't started yet:
1. Go to **Benefits** workspace.
2. Select the tile for the group of employees to send email.
3. Click **Send email**.
4. Select the employees that you want to email.
5. Click **Send email**.
6. Select the template that you want to use.
7. Click **Ok** to send the email.
