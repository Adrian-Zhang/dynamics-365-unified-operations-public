## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing

## Features on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.30. Most features that have been turned on automatically can be turned off in 
Feature management. In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory to ensure
that customers are using current functionality. In this way, enhancements can build on the current functionality as they are added. Features will never be automatically
enabled in less than one year unless they are determined to be essential.
