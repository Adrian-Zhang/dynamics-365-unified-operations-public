# Capture bulk orders quickly

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]


This topic describes the capabilities for enabling the B2B site users to place the orders quickly.
Inspired from the experiences provided by B2C e-commerce websites, the B2B e-commerce website from Dynamics 365 Commerce allows the users to discover new products via search/browse, view product details, add items to cart and checkout. However, unlike the consumers of B2C site, who generally order items in small quantities and usually order only once, the B2B consumers usually order in large quantities and reorder the items multiple times. Moreover, these users usually know exactly what item they want to buy and thus often they skip the product discoverability phase and jump right to the ordering. To cater for such needs, the B2B e-commerce website provides various capabilities as described in this article.

## Bulk order by item number
The B2B e-commerce website enables the site users to add items to the item using the item number of the products along with the desired quantity.

## Bulk order by variants
The B2B e-commerce website enables the site users to quickly add different variants of the same product in a single view. The users have inventory visibility by the size, color, and style in a single view. Additionally, using the “Enter all quantities” button above the control, the user can easily enter the same quantity for all the in-stock products.

## Leverage order templates for quick order entry
It is common for the buyers on the B2B website to order certain items together. For example, if you are placing orders for a construction site then you might want to order shirts, jackets, pants, shoes, and hat together. Similarly, if different job roles have different uniforms e.g. in a hospital there are different uniforms for doctors, nurses, cleaning staff etc. So, you might want to group these different uniforms together for easier ordering. For such scenarios, the B2B site provides the capability of creating order templates. The users can create any number of templates and can order all or selected items from these templates as required.

## Reorder from order history

The B2B e-commerce website enables the site users to quickly reorder items from their order history. Referring to the image below, the user can choose to buy selected items from the order history or add all the items to the cart.

These are just some of the ways by which the B2B site enables the users to quickly order the products they want. More capabilities are in development to further simplify and bulk order capture process.
