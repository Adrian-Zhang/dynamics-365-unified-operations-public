# Manage business partner users on B2B e-commerce websites using Dynamics 365 Sales

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales to manage business partner approvals for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce business-to-business (B2B) websites. Organizations that have already invested in the Dynamics 365 Sales solution can leverage the lead and opportunity concepts of Dynamics 365 Sales for the B2B e-commerce business partner approval process.

For background information on the B2B business partner approval process, see [Manage business partner users on B2B e-commerce websites](manage-b2b-users.md).
 
Potential business partners can initiate the onboarding process to a B2B e-commerce website by submitting an onboarding request via a link on the B2B website. After the request is submitted and the relevant jobs such as **P-0001** and **Synchronize orders and channel requests** job have been run in Commerce headquarters, the onboarding request is saved on the **All prospects** form in headquarters. The business partner prospect approval process can then be completed in the Dynamics 365 Sales application. 

After enabling integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Commerce, the creation of a business partner prospect in Dynamics 365 Commerce results in the creation of a *lead* in Dynamics 365 Sales. 

The following image shows an example of a lead creation page for a business partner prospect in Dynamics 365 Sales.

In the image above the person who submitted the onboarding request is shown under the **Contact** section and the organization is shown under the **Company** section. A note shows that this lead was generated by the dual-write infrastructure. Since this lead was created by the dual-write infrastructure, the lead will not appear under the **My open leads** drop-down list but will appear under a new view titled **All commerce B2B leads**.

As per the standard lead qualification process in Dynamics 365 Sales, when a user "qualifies" the lead this results in the creation of an *opportunity* record, a *contact* record, and an *account* record. Using the dual-write infrastructure, the contact and the account records are written to Dynamics 365 Commerce and the contact is created as a customer of type *person* and the company is created as a customer of type *organization*. If a user selects **Close as Won** for the opportunity, this will result in the approval of the *prospect* in Dynamics 365 Commerce, and the approval of a prospect results in a creation of a customer hierarchy. 

The rest of the business processes such as sending email to the business partner, defining credit limit management on the users, and adding additional users to the B2B site all occur in Dynamics 365 Commerce. However, if instead of qualifying the lead the user disqualifies the lead or marks the opportunity as lost, the *prospect* in Dynamics 365 Commerce is marked as rejected and the decline onboarding email is sent to the requestor.

## Enable integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Commerce

Integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Commerce relies on the dual-write infrastructure, so dual-write should be enabled and working such that the customers created in one system are written to the other system. For more information on the dual-write infrastructure, see [Dual-write overview](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-overview).

Once the dual-write setup has been completed, the implementation partner can go to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) and search for the solution named [Dual-write Commerce solutions](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/offers/7ca1d8c9-dc79-4cb7-a82e-8dc96a25acca/overview). Install the package using the standard installation wizard and then test it by creating a prospect on a B2B site. After creating the prospect, verify that the request is displayed on the **All prospects** form in Dynamics 365 Commerce, and then verify that it is displayed as a lead in Dynamics 365 Sales.
