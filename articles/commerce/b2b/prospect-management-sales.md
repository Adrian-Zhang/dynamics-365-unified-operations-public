# Manage business partner users on B2B e-commerce websites using Dynamics 365 Sales

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to use Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales to manage business partner approvals for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce B2B websites. Organizations who have already invested in the Dynamics 365 Sales solution can leverage the lead and opportunity concepts of the Sales application for B2B e-commerce business partner approval process.

> [!NOTE]
> Reviewing [Manage business partner users on B2B e-commerce websites](manage-b2b-users.md) is a prerequisite for getting the most out of this topic.
 
Potential business partners can initiate the onboarding process to a B2B e-commerce website by submitting an onboarding request via a link on the website. After the request is submitted and the relevant jobs such as **P-0001** and **Synchronize orders and channel requests**  job have been run, the onboarding request is saved on the **All prospects** form in Dynamics 365 Commerce. At this point the business partner prospect approval process can be completed in the Dynamics 365 Sales application. 

After enabling integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Commerce, the creation of a business partner prospect in Dynamics 365 Commerce results in the creation of a *lead* in Dynamics 365 Sales. 

The following image shows an example of a lead creation page for a business partner prospect in Dynamics 365 Sales.

In the image above the person who submitted the onboarding request is shown under the **Contact** section and the organization is shown under the **Company** section. A note shows that this lead was generated by the dual-write infrastructure. Since this lead was created by the dual-write infrastructure, the lead will not appear under the **My open leads** drop-down list but will appear under a new view titled **All commerce B2B leads**.

As per the standard lead qualification process in Dynamics 365 Sales, when a user "qualifies" the lead this results in the creation of an **Opportunity**, a **Contact**, and an **Account** record. Using the dual-write infrastructure, the contact and the account records are written to Dynamics 365 Commerce and the contact is created as a customer of type **Person** and the company is created as a customer of type **Organization**. If a user marks the **Opportunity** as **Close as Won** this will result in the approval of the **Prospect** in Dynamics 365 Commerce, and the approval of a prospect results in a creation of a customer hierarchy. 

The rest of the business processes such as sending email to the business partner, defining credit limit management on the users, and adding additional users to the B2B site all occur in Dynamics 365 Commerce. However, if instead of qualifying the lead the user disqualified the lead or marked the opportunity as lost, the **Prospect** in Dynamics 365 Commerce would have been marked as rejected and the decline onboarding email would be sent to the requestor.

## Enable integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Commerce

Integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Commerce relies on Dual-write so that application should be enabled and working such that the customers created in one system are written to the other system. For more information on the dual-write infrastructure, see [Dual-write overview](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-overview).

Once the dual-write setup has been completed, the implementation partner can go to Microsoft AppSource and search for the solution named [Dual-write Commerce solutions](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/offers/7ca1d8c9-dc79-4cb7-a82e-8dc96a25acca/overview). Install the package using the standard installation wizard and then test it by creating a prospect on a B2B site. First verify that the request is displayed on the **All prospects** form in Dynamics 365 Commerce, and then verify that it is displayed as a lead in Dynamics 365 Sales.
