# Leverage Dynamics 365 Sales for business partner approvals

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how the organizations who have already invested in the Dynamics 365 Sales solution can leverage the lead and opportunity concepts of the Sales application for B2B e-commerce business partner approval process.

> [!NOTE]
> The document [Business partner approval](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/b2b/manage-b2b-users) is a prerequisite for this article.
 
As mentioned in the article [Business partner onboarding]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/b2b/manage-b2b-users) potential business partners can initiate the onboarding process to a B2B e-commerce website by submitting an onboarding request via a link on the website. After the request is submitted and the relevant jobs such as **P-0001** and **Synchronize orders and channel requests**  job are run, the onboarding request is saved on the “All prospects” form in the Dynamics 365 Commerce. From this point, the prospect approval process can be completed in the Dynamics 365 Sales application. 

Assuming the setup explained later in this article is completed, the creation of a prospect in Dynamics 365 Commerce application would result in a creation of a Lead in Dynamics 365 Sales application. Referring to the below image, you can see that the person who submitted the onboarding request is shown under the ‘Contact’ section of the lead and the organization is shown under the ‘Company’ section of the lead. Moreover, a note shows that this lead was generated by the Dual-write application. Please note that since this lead was created by the Dual write application, so the lead will not show under the “My open leads” dropdown, rather it is shown under a new view titled “All commerce B2B leads”.

As per the standard lead qualification process in Sales, when the user “Qualifies” the lead, this results in creation of an Opportunity along with a creation of a Contact and an Account record. Using Dual-write, the contact and the account records are written to the Dynamics 365 Commerce application and thus the contact is created as a customer of type “Person” and the company is created as a customer of type “Organization”. Now, if the user marks the Opportunity as “Close as Won”, then this results in the approval of the Prospect in the Dynamics 365 Commerce application and again, as mentioned in the article [Business partner onboarding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/b2b/manage-b2b-users), the approval of a prospect results in a creation of a customer hierarchy. 

The rest of the business processes such as sending email to the business partner, defining credit limit management on the users, adding additional users to the B2B site etc. all occur in Dynamics 365 commerce. However, if instead of qualifying the lead the user disqualified the lead or marked the opportunity as lost, the Prospect in Dynamics 365 Commerce would have been marked as rejected and the decline onboarding email would be sent to the requestor.

## Enable integration between Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Commerce

This integration relies on Dual-write and hence Dual-write should be enabled and working such that the customers created in one system are being dual written in the other system. You can find more information on Dual-write here: [Dual write overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-overview)

Once the dual write setup is completed, the implementation partner can go to the app source and search for the solution named - [Dual-write Commerce solutions](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/offers/7ca1d8c9-dc79-4cb7-a82e-8dc96a25acca/overview). Simply install this package using the standard installation wizard and then test by creating a prospect on the B2B site. Verify that this request is first displayed on the “All prospects” form in Dynamics 365 Commerce and then displayed as a lead in the Dynamics 365 Sales application.
