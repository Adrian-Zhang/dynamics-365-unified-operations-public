# Integrate Customer Voice into an e-commerce page

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

[Customer Voice](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/customer-voice/overview/) can be used to collect, analyze and track real-time feedback within your e-commerce web site.  This topic will cover the steps needed to integrate the service into Dynamics 365 Commerce e-commerce platform.

As a pre-requisite you will require an account within Dynamics 365 Customer Voice and have created the desired survey. 

## Service Integration
1. Select the survey you will be using from the [Customer Voice](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ProjectPage.aspx.) portal.
2. Select the **Send** tab and the **Embed** link which will provide the necessary code to embed within the site builder tool and select the type of survey you want as shown below.  We'll use the **Button** type for this example.
