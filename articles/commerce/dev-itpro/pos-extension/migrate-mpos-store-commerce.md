1. [Create a new device in headquarters](../../tasks/create-associate-device.md), or if you want to migrate an existing device, select the device and change the application type to **Store Commerce** on the headquarters **Devices** page and then run the **Registers (1070)** and **Channel configuration (1090)* jobs.
1. Uninstall MPOS. You donâ€™t have to uninstall the offline database.
1. Download the Store Commerce installer from [LCS Shared asset library](https://lcs.dynamics.com/V2/SharedAssetLibrary). On the **Shared asset library** page, select **Retail Self-service package** as the asset type, and then find the file that ends with **Store Commerce**.

    [!NOTE]
    The existing offline database can be updated by passing the correct SQL instance in the installer parameter, or you can also create a new offline database. These steps are only required if you need offline mode.
