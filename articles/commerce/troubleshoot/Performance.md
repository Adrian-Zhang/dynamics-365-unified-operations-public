### Troubleshoot Store Commerce performance issues

This topic explains how to troubleshoot Store Commerce performance issues.

- When troubleshooting performance issues for Store Commerce, avoid remote login and instead do direct login to the Store Commerce device.
- If the Store Commerce app is slow, check the CPU, memory, network and disk usage using task manager or resource monitor and make sure there is no significant consumption of the device resources.
- Check your network connectivity status and see if https requests/responses are not taking more than few seconds.
