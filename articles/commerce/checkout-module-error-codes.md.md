# Checkout module error reference codes

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

This article describes the checkout module error codes displayed in user-facing error messages in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

Dynamics 365 Commerce has introduced standardized error references to be included in online channel checkout errors presented to online customers. Available in Commerce version 10.0.31 and later, error messages in the checkout module include error codes that reference errors detailed in this article without displaying unnecessary information to the online customer. 

Depending upon the error encountered, the table below will:

- Describe the condition that caused the error or provide additional details.
- Provide information for consideration in the environment or payment connector configurations.
- Include information that can be referenced in a support case, if needed for additional assistance.

## Checkout module error reference codes

Use the following table to reference an error code reference provided by a customer or experienced on the online store for additional details of the code.
