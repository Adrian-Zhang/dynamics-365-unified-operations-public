# Add a robots.txt file

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to create (or edit), upload, and validate the robots.txt file for each domain hosted in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce. 

Unexpected or undirected crawling of your site by search engines can result in a high volume of page not found errors, leading to performance issues as the site responds to the many requests for pages that do not exist. To help alleviate this problem, you should always upload a valid robots.txt file to guide conforming crawlers to crawl only relevant pages on your site.

- **Version:** Commerce 10.0.16 or later

You are a Commerce system admin.

## Steps to complete

<code>
User-agent: *
Disallow: /signin
Disallow: /cart
Disallow: /*?refiners=

</code>
1. Create or download a robots.txt file

Disallow: /signin
