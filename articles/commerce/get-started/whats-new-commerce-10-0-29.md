| Feature area | Feature | More information | Enabled by |
|---|---|---|---|




## Feature state changes in this release

The following table lists features that became mandatory or on by default starting in 10.0.29. All of these features will automatically be turned on for your system as soon as you update to 10.0.29. Mandatory features can't be turned off, but features that are on by default can still be turned off using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

The table also lists features that were previously in public preview, but have changed to become generally available in 10.0.29, which means they are now recommended for use on production environments. These features are turned off by default unless otherwise noted, so you must use [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) to enable them if you want to use them.

### Removed and deprecated features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article describes features that have been removed or deprecated for Commerce.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) article 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
