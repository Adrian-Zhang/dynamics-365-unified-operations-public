The following table lists the features that are included in this release. The *Feature* column provides links to the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/planned-features), where you can see the official release dates for each feature. The *More information* column provides more details and/or links to related documentation. To determine how to turn on a feature, see the *Enabled by* column. For more information about how to use feature management, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are new for this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/commerce/dynamics365-commerce/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted).

If you want to turn any of these features on or off, you must do so in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md), where they are listed using the names shown in the *Feature name in feature management* column of the following table.

| Module | Feature name in feature management | More information |
|---|---|---|

### Removed and deprecated features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) topic describes features that have been removed or deprecated for Commerce.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Commerce](removed-deprecated-features-commerce.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.
