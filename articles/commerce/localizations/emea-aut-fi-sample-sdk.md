# Deploying the fiscal registration service integration sample for Austria from the Retail SDK

The fiscal registration service integration sample for Austria is part of the Retail SDK. For information about how to install and use the SDK, see the [Retail software development kit (SDK) architecture](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-overview.md).

This sample consists of extensions for the CRT, Hardware station, and POS. To run this sample, you must modify and build the CRT, Hardware station, and POS projects. We recommend that you use an unmodified Retail SDK to make the changes that are described in this topic. We also recommend that you use a source control system, such as Azure DevOps, where no files have been changed yet.

## Development environment

Follow these steps to set up a development environment so that you can test and extend the sample.

### Enable Commerce runtime extensions

The CRT extension components are included in the CRT samples. To complete the following procedures, open the CRT solution, **CommerceRuntimeSamples.sln**, under **RetailSdk\\SampleExtensions\\CommerceRuntime**.

#### DocumentProvider.EFRSample component

1. Find the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.EFRSample** project, and build it.
2. In the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.EFRSample\\bin\\Debug** folder, find the **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.EFRSample.dll** assembly file.
3. Copy the assembly file to the CRT extensions folder:

    - **Commerce Scale Unit:** Copy the assembly to the **\\bin\\ext** folder under the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Commerce Scale Unit site location.
    - **Local CRT on Modern POS:** Copy the assembly to the **\\ext** folder under the local CRT client broker location.

4. Find the extension configuration file for CRT:

    - **Commerce Scale Unit:** The file is named **commerceruntime.ext.config**, and it's in the **bin\\ext** folder under the IIS Commerce Scale Unit site location.
    - **Local CRT on Modern POS:** The file is named **CommerceRuntime.MPOSOffline.Ext.config**, and it's under the local CRT client broker location.

5. Register the CRT change in the extension configuration file.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.EFRSample" />
    ```

#### DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR component

1. Find the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR** project, and build it.
2. In the **Runtime.Extensions.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR\\bin\\Debug** folder, find the **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR.dll** assembly file.
3. Copy the assembly file to the CRT extensions folder:

    - **Commerce Scale Unit:** Copy the assembly to the **\\bin\\ext** folder under the IIS Commerce Scale Unit site location.
    - **Local CRT on Modern POS:** Copy the assembly to the **\\ext** folder under the local CRT client broker location.

4. Find the extension configuration file for CRT:

    - **Commerce Scale Unit:** The file is named **commerceruntime.ext.config**, and it's in the **bin\\ext** folder under the IIS Commerce Scale Unit site location.
    - **Local CRT on Modern POS:** The file is named **CommerceRuntime.MPOSOffline.Ext.config**, and it's under the local CRT client broker location.

5. Register the CRT change in the extension configuration file.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR" />
    ```
#### Update extension configuration file

1. Find the extension configuration file for CRT:

    - **Commerce Scale Unit:** The file is named **commerceruntime.ext.config**, and it's in the **bin\\ext** folder under the IIS Commerce Scale Unit site location.
    - **Local CRT on Modern POS:** The file is named **CommerceRuntime.MPOSOffline.Ext.config**, and it's under the local CRT client broker location.

2. Register the CRT change in the extension configuration file.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.ReceiptsAustria" />
    <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.RegisterAuditEventAustria" />
    <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.XZReportsAustria" />
    ```
### Enable Hardware station extensions

The Hardware station extension components are included in the Hardware station samples. To complete the following procedures, open the solution, **HardwareStationSamples.sln**, under **RetailSdk\\SampleExtensions\\HardwareStation**.

#### EFRSample component

1. Find the **HardwareStation.Extension.EFRSample** project, and build it.
2. In the **Extension.EFRSample\\bin\\Debug** folder, find following files:

    - The **Contoso.Commerce.HardwareStation.EFRSample.dll** assembly
    - The **Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR.dll** assembly

3. Copy the assembly files to the Hardware station extensions folder:

    - **Shared hardware station:** Copy the files to the **bin** folder under the IIS Hardware station site location.
    - **Dedicated hardware station on Modern POS:** Copy the files to the Modern POS client broker location.

4. Find the extension configuration file for the Hardware station's extensions. The file is named **HardwareStation.Extension.config**.

    - **Shared hardware station:** The file is located under the IIS Hardware station site location.
    - **Dedicated hardware station on Modern POS:** The file is located under the Modern POS client broker location.

5. Add the following line to the **composition** section of the configuration file.

    ``` xml
    <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.HardwareStation.EFRSample.dll" />
    ```

### Enable Modern POS extension components

1. Open the solution at **RetailSdk\\POS\\ModernPOS.sln**, and make sure that it can be compiled without errors. Additionally, make sure that you can run Modern POS from Microsoft Visual Studio by using the **Run** command.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Modern POS must not be customized. You must enable User Account Control (UAC), and you must uninstall previously installed instances of Modern POS as required.
2. Enable the extensions to be loaded by adding the following lines in **extensions.json**.

    ``` json
    {
        "extensionPackages": [
            {
                "baseUrl": "Microsoft/AuditEvent.AT"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information, and for samples that show how to include source code folders and enable extensions to be loaded, see the instructions in the readme.md file in the **Pos.Extensions** project.
3. Rebuild the solution.
4. Run Modern POS in the debugger, and test the functionality.

### Enable Cloud POS extension components

1. Open the solution at **RetailSdk\\POS\\CloudPOS.sln**, and make sure that it can be compiled without errors.
2. Enable the extensions to be loaded by adding the following lines in **extensions.json**.

    ``` json
    {
        "extensionPackages": [
            {
                "baseUrl": "Microsoft/AuditEvent.AT"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information, and for samples that show how to include source code folders and enable extensions to be loaded, see the instructions in the readme.md file in the **Pos.Extensions** project.
3. Rebuild the solution.
4. Run the solution by using the **Run** command and following the steps in the Retail SDK handbook.

## Production environment

The previous procedure enables the extensions that are components of the fiscal registration service integration sample. In addition, you must follow these steps to create deployable packages that contain Commerce components, and to apply those packages in a production environment.

1. Make the following changes in the package configuration files under the **RetailSdk\\Assets** folder:

    - In the **commerceruntime.ext.config** and **CommerceRuntime.MPOSOffline.Ext.config** configuration files, add the following lines to the **composition** section.

        ``` xml
        <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.EFRSample" />
        <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR" />
        <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.ReceiptsAustria" />
        <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.RegisterAuditEventAustria" />
        <add source="assembly" value="Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.Runtime.XZReportsAustria" />
        ```

    - In the **HardwareStation.Extension.config** configuration file, add the following line to the **composition** section.

        ``` xml
        <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.HardwareStation.EFRSample" />
        <add source="assembly" value="Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR" />
        ```

2. Make the following changes in the **BuildTools\\Customization.settings** package customization configuration file:

    - Add the following lines to include the CRT extensions in the deployable packages.

        ``` xml
        <ISV_CommerceRuntime_CustomizableFile Include="$(SdkReferencesPath)\Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.EFRSample.dll" />
        <ISV_CommerceRuntime_CustomizableFile Include="$(SdkReferencesPath)\Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR.dll" />
        ```

    - Add the following line to include the Hardware station extension in the deployable packages.

        ``` xml
        <ISV_HardwareStation_CustomizableFile Include="$(SdkReferencesPath)\Contoso.Commerce.HardwareStation.EFRSample.dll" />
        <ISV_HardwareStation_CustomizableFile Include="$(SdkReferencesPath)\Contoso.Commerce.Runtime.DocumentProvider.DataModelEFR.dll" />
        ```

3. Start the MSBuild Command Prompt for Visual Studio utility, and run **msbuild** under the Retail SDK folder to create deployable packages.
4. Apply the packages via Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) or manually. For more information, see [Create deployable packages](../dev-itpro/retail-sdk/retail-sdk-packaging.md).
5. Complete all the required setup tasks that are described in the [Set up Commerce for Austria](#set-up-commerce-for-austria) section.
