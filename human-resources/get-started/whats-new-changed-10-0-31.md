## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements that are included in this release. Each of these enhancements provides an incremental improvement to an existing 
feature. Because they are only enhancements, they aren't listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance).

| Feature name | More information |
|--------------|------------------|
|Task management |Previously when making updates to a task, the user needed to go to each checklist that contained the task and update the tasks individually. Changes in the 10.0.30 release added the option to update checklist tasks when a library task is edited. For those edits to be applied to all associated checklist tasks, a relationship must already exist between the task in the task library and the task in the checklist. Prior to the 10.0.30 release a relationship was not created. An upgrade has been created to create the relationship between the library task and the checklist task.|

## Features on by default in this release

The following table lists the features that are turned on by default in version 10.0.31. Most features that have been turned on automatically can be turned off in Feature management. In the future, some features that have been turned on automatically might be removed from Feature management and will become mandatory to ensure that customers are using current functionality. In this way, enhancements can build on the current functionality as they are added. Features will never be automatically enabled in less than one year unless they are determined to be essential.
